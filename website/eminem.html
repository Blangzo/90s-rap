        <h2>About Eminem:</h2>
        <p>Eminem (born Marshall Bruce Mathers III) is a rapper and record producer. He is
            considered to be one of the most controversial and best selling-artists of the century.
            His most popular albums are The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Recovery.
            The Slim Shady LP (which was one of the albums we analyzed for this project) was
            released in 1999 and went multi-platinum. Eminem also received two Grammy awards and
            four MTV Videos Music awards for this album.</p>
        <p>He was born on October 17, 1972 in Missouri. His father, Marshall Mathers Jr., abandoned
            the family when Eminem was just born and ended all contact with Eminem. His mother,
            Deborah, raised him and she struggled to maintain a job for longer than a few months.
            They moved quite often between Missouri and Detroit. Eminem recalled that he would
            change schools two or three times a year and that this time period was the toughest
            during his childhood. He didn’t have many friends, was very introverted and was treated
            as an outcast. He was also bullied a lot at each new school. Eminem accused his mother
            of not properly raising him and expresses this through his song lyrics, noting her
            addiction to prescription drugs and subjecting him to emotional and physical abuse. He
            ended up failing ninth grade three times and then dropped out of school completely when
            he was 17. However, he was very passionate for language, and would always be reading,
            even the dictionary. Because of Eminem’s very wide range of vocabulary, he found his
            passion for hip-hop and creating songs.</p>
        <p>During the late-1980s and the early-1990s, he entered into many rap competitions in
            Detroit. This was a unique case since at this time rap music was only produced by
            African American people, while Eminem is a Caucasian. Despite his racial background, he
            was able to prove himself and gain the upmost respect of this rap scene because of his
            advanced level of vocabulary and verbal sparring. He started to use the stage name,
            M&amp;M, which referenced his initials, but then changed it to Eminem. He then started
            to date Kim Ann Scoot, and the two had a daughter together, whose name is Hailie.
            Because he wanted to give his daughter a better life than he had, he released his first
            album, Infiinite (the other album that we analyzed in this project). However, he did not
            profit from this album and was only recognized on a local level.</p>
        <p>Eninem then released The Slim Shady EP, which was discovered by the famous rapper and
            producer, Dr. Dre. Extremely impressed by Eminem’s rap songs, Dr. Dre signed him
            immediately to his Interscope Records label. Then they released the album, The Slim
            Shady LP, two years later. It was a huge success and sold over three million copies. </p>
