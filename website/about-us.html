        <h1>About us:</h1>
        <p>Hello! This website was set up by 2 University of Pittsburgh students, Wesley Ho and
            Monica Felix, to display our work analyzing 90s rap music for our class Computational
            Methods in the Humanities.</p>

        <h2>Wesley Ho</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm a 2021 graduate of the University of Pittsburgh main campus where I am
            working towards a bachelors degree in Information Science as well as considering a
            second major in economics. As a member of the Rap-90s project, I wrote the schema, some
            of the lyrics, most of the website, and worked on the varius data visualizations
            included in the website.</p>
