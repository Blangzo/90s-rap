<verse>Meet Cindi
She's twenty-two, lives right on the dope track
Used to be fat now weighs less than a Tic Tac
Now what's that say about this big epidemic
This hypocritical world and the people in it
Now speakin' of, in it Cindi loved to get buckwild
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> with a smile single file she'll bust enough styles
That would be cool, if she was your lover
But <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> that, Cindi was my dope fiend mother
Welfare checks never stepped through the front door
Cause moms would run to the dopeman once more
All those days, had me fiendin' for a hot meal
Now I'm a crook; got steel, I do not feel
So don't even trip, when I flip with my thirty-eight
Revenge is a <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> and my hit shake the murder rate
Word to the mother, I'm touched
When moms come by, <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> hush or get rushed
Maybe one day she'll recover
But what will it take, to shake, or break
My part time mutha
I gotta live with a part time</verse>

<verse><featuredSinger>[Angelique]</featuredSinger>
I grew up in a home where no-one liked me
<phrase type="lifeEvent">Moms would hit the pipe, every night, she would fight me</phrase>
Poppa was a nasty old man, like the rest
<phrase type="lifeEvent">He's feelin' on my chest, with his hand in my dress</phrase>
Just another pest and yes I was nervous
Was this a test? I just don't deserve this
I wanna tell mom, but would she listen
She's bound to be <phrase type="profanity">bitchin'</phrase> if she hasn't got a fix in, so
Now I lay me down to sleep, Lord don't let him rape me
If he does my soul to keep, don't let the devil take me
Can't concentrate I contemplate in my classroom
<phrase type="lifeEvent">Thinkin' how my step dad raped me in the bathroom</phrase>
<phrase type="lifeEvent">Every day I make class and yet I'm missin' periods</phrase>
The thought of pregnancy is in my head and now I'm <emotion>fearin'</emotion> it
I gotta tell mom before she sees me
<phrase type="lifeEvent">I told her how he treated me and she didn't believe me</phrase>
Callin' me a slut cause my butt's kinda big so
Still that ain't no way to be talkin' to your kids though
I can't believe the way he caught her
Got her believin' him and dissin' her own daughter
Time for me to break and find another
That's when I discovered
The ways of the days of a part time mutha

I rush to tend her, talked as I touch her
She blushed, the clothes came off and I bust her
I'm up now, ready to get drunk on the block
Here, take a cab, thanks a lot for the cock
She's gone and I'm thinkin' that my game's so strong
Pat myself on the back and move on
Is this just how it is <phrase type="profanity">hell</phrase> no
<phrase type="lifeEvent">Cause she came back with the kid and yo</phrase>
I been payin' ever since
The clothes the food the cars and, oh, the rent
All of my time gets spent at the workplace
No time to kiss her got me this in the first place
So, I do the dishes and clean the floor
When I sleep I can't dream no more
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha
And I change the diapers and clean the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>
The tables are turned I can't take this
Oh no, now I'm a part time mutha</verse>
