# Meeting Notes
10/13 & 10/14 

I. Refined research question: 

- Plan to compare the characteristics between songs from the same artist that became popular to those which did not gain much attention to assess whether or not there are key differences between the two. Among these characteristics are tempo, topic, language, repitition/patterns, etc

II. For Tuesday's meeting:

- Create list of potential songs
- Gather majority of lyrics
- Begin preliminary mark up (artist, date, rank)
- Think about other potential sources for material
