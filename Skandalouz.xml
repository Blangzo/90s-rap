Hey Nate, you know you got the vocals on this <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase>
We finna talk about these scandalous <phrase type="profanity">hoes</phrase>
I can talk about scandalous <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase>
I know you can!
I know you that's why we finna do it
Daz on the beat
Hey Daz, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> stop <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> around with the piano <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
Just drop that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> like uhh, this here

<verse><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
I met you through my homie now you act like you don't know me
So disappointed 'cause baby that shit was so phoney
It's not for me, you see no lovin' from my closest homies
Woulda paid you no mind, but baby you was all up on me
While you proceed with precision, you had the table hosed
No, I ain't mad at you baby, go 'head and play them fools
They chose not to listen, so now he stuck inside his house
And can't leave without his bitch permission
The mission's to be a playa, my alias is Boss
Drop a top on these jealous niggas, playa let me floss
Y'all don't wanna see me in pain
I'll leave that ass like Toni Braxton, never breathin' again
It's scandalous, I never liked your back stabbin' ass, triiick
Used to watch you money grabbin', who you baggin' beeyitch?
Ready to bust, in the city you don't know who to trust
But bitches lookin' scandalous</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Nate Dogg]</featuredSinger>
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous</chorus>

<verse><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
How's it hangin'? 'Cause baby from the back the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> is bangin'
I've been stressing in this ghetto game, trying to do my thang
Won't be no <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase>, no <phrase type="profanity">ass-kissin'</phrase>
This <phrase type="profanity">bitch'll</phrase> have ya wakin' up with all your cash missin'
I'm askin', as if I'm qualified to analyze
You're lookin' at a <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> who specialize in tellin' lies
She got a body make a <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> fantasize
Her face ain't never shed a tear through them scandalous eyes
My sister precious in poverty
Plus I knew she was a <phrase type="dt">freak</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> so why should it bother me?
I'd probably be sprung, addicted to the heat of her tongue
And though I don't where we're goin', she's makin' me come
I've been trained as a boss playa, so what you saying?
Let me show you, got some hookers we can toss later
Before I let her get me, I got her
Went in her purse took a hundred dollars
<phrase type="profanity">Nigga</phrase> I'm so scandalous</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Nate Dogg]</featuredSinger>
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous</chorus>

<verse><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
Dangerous and ambitious, while schemin' on gettin' riches
I'm spittin' at <phrase type="dt">tricks</phrase> 'cause I'm addicted to pretty <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase>
Currency motivated, not easily terminated
Now that we made it, my <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> can never be faded
This is my prophecy, I gotta be paid
All you cowards that try to stop me is beggin' for early graves
I thought we was cool, I was a fool, thinkin' you could be true
When I don't <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with your punk crew
These are the tales for my <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> doin' time in the cell
I went from hell, to livin' well
Busting at <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> who said my name in vain
I got no time for them tricks, I'm heavy in the game
I wanna be a baller, please
But the <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase> and the liquor keep on calling me
I'm tokin' free on the highway, formulatin' plans
Can't wait til I see L.A., 'cause it's so scandalous</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Nate Dogg]</featuredSinger>
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
Scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous
She's so scandalous!, she's so scandalous, she's so scandalous</chorus>

<outro><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
Aiyyo.. how the prettiest <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> be the more scandalous the <phrase type="dt">hoe</phrase> be
You ever peep that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>? (Nah)
A <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> can be like 15, <phrase type="profanity">fucking</phrase> with a nigga 35
Gettin' him for everything
<phrase type="dt">Hoes</phrase> these days is way too <phrase type="profanity">motherfucking</phrase> intelligent
When these <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> get to tricking, hahaha, it's over then
That's aight though
Keep a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> heavy in the game, 'bout so long
Watch them <phrase type="dt">hoes</phrase>
All you <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> out there
Beware these lying <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> scandalous bitches</outro></lyrics></song>
