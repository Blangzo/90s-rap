<lyrics><verse>
They claim that I'm violent
Just cause I refuse to be silent
These hypocrites are havin' fits
’Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it
<emotion>Envious</emotion> because I will rebel against
Any oppressor - and this is known as self defense
I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic
But when the <profanity>shit</profanity> gets thick, I'm the one you go and get
Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see
’Cause I'm the <profanity>nigga</profanity> that you sell-outs are <emotion>ashamed</emotion> to be
In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this
I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished
The Underground Railroad on an uprise
This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies
I told 'em fight back, attack on society
If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be
If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from
Look through our history, America's the violent one
Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery
This time the payback for evil <profanity>shit</profanity> you did to me
They call me militant, racist, cause I will resist
You wanna censor somethin', <profanity>motherfucker</profanity> censor this!
My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent
Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent</verse>

<chorus>[Hook]
"They claimin' that I'm violent"
"<profanity>Fuck</profanity> the <profanity>damn</profanity> cop!"
"Just because we play what the people want"</chorus>

<verse>[Verse 2]
The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me
Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats
Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID
I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"
He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew
("Do you know what time it is?
Get out the <profanity>fucking</profanity> car, or I'll hurt you!")
Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you
So here I go, I better make my mind up
Pick my nine up or hit the line-up
I chose B, stepped into the streets
The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat
They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete
(Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)
("What you doin man?")
They tried to frame me
They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat
But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend
My homie panicked ("I'm out") he tried to run
(Freeze <profanity>nigga</profanity>!) I heard a bullet fire from the cop's gun
My homie dropped, so I hit the cop
I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop
Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless
The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless
(Argh, <profanity>fuck</profanity> you! Ungh!)
Now I'm against this cop who was racist
Givin' him a taste, of trading places
And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this
Frame up, but I came up
Now they claimin' that I'm violent</verse>

<chorus>[Hook]
"They claimin' that I'm violent"
"<profanity>Fuck</profanity> the <profanity>damn</profanity> cop!"
"Just because we play what the people want"
</chorus>
<verse>[Verse 3]
As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)
Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit
I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand
He shot the cop (<profanity>Damn</profanity>!) now he's a dead man
I said, come on, it's time for us to get away
(Let's go, we gotta get the <profanity>fuck</profanity> outta here.)
They called for backup, and they'll be on their way
Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick
The car wouldn't start (<profanity>Damn</profanity>!) we in deep shit
So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)
We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far
But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights
(that's a lotta of one time)
If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight
I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge
(yeah, it's on now)
Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray
We'll shoot 'em up with they own <profanity>fuckin'</profanity> weapons
And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'
This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops
You <profanity>fuck</profanity> with real <profanity>niggas</profanity>, get ya <profanity>fuckin'</profanity> <profanity>ass</profanity> dropped
So here we go, the police against us
Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust
(What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care
One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here
But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me
(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me
You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent
Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent</verse>

<chorus>[Hook]
"They claimin' that I'm violent"
"<profanity>Fuck</profanity> the <profanity>damn</profanity> cop!"
