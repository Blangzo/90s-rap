<lyrics><intro>
"What's up?"
"Yo this scene, rollers tried to jack a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> 'cause a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> with a pearl rollin' on a Coupé with goldens"
"Yo man, what's up, this riding <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase>
Jack me at rollin' 'round bumping
’Cause music's too loud, you know what I'm sayin'?"
"Yo this P-O to the G-O
<phrase type="profanity">Motherfucking</phrase> cop just jacked me 'cause I was drinking beer in Mill Valley"
"What's up man?"
"Aight' man, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> 'em"</intro>

<verse>[2Pac]
I don't give a <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase>
They done pushed me to my limit, I'm all in
I might blow up any minute, did it again
And now I'm in the back of the paddy wagon
While this cop's bragging about the <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> he's jackin'
I see no justice, all I see is <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> dying fast
The sound of a gun blast, then watch the hearse pass
Just another day in the life, G
Gotta step lightly, cause cops tried to snipe me
The cabs, they don't wanna stop for a brother, man
But <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase> near have an accident to pick up another man
I went to the bank to cash my check
I get more respect from the <phrase type="profanity">mothafucking</phrase> dope man
The Grammy's and American Music shows
They pimp us like <phrase type="dt">hoes</phrase>, take our dough, but they hate us though
You better keep your mind on the real shit
And <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> trying to get with these crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> hypocrites
The way they see it, we was meant to be kept down
Just can't understand why we getting respect now
<phrase type="lifeEvent">Mama told me there'd be days like this</phrase>
But I'm pissed, cause it stays like this
And now they're trying to ship me off to Kuwait?
Give me a break, how much <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> can a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> take?
I ain't going nowhere no how
Bush wanna throw down?
Better bring the gun, pal
Cause this is the day we make 'em pay
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> bailing hay, I better spray with an AK
And even if they shoot me down
There'll be another <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> bigger from the <phrase type="profanity">mothafuckin'</phrase> underground
So step but you better step quick
Cause the clock's going tick and I'm sick of the <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase>
You're watching the makings of a psychopath
But you sit and laugh before the wrath and aftermath
Who's that behind the trigger?
Who do you think? A <phrase type="profanity">mothafucking</phrase> 90's <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
Ready to buck and rip <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> up, I had enough!
(Yeah) And I just Don't Give a <phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase></verse>

<verse>[Verse 2: Pogo]
<phrase type="profanity">Nigga</phrase>, it ain't just the blacks
It's also a gang of <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> dressed in blue slacks
They say <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> hang in packs and they attitudes is <phrase type="profanity">shitty</phrase>
So tell me, who's the biggest gang of <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> in the city?
They say we <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> like to do <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
So me an' a cop are just two <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
A street walking <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> and a beat walking <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
With a badge, I end his future and his past
With a blast take his cash before I dash I bash his head in
Dump him at the dead end and that's just his luck
Cause a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> like P, don't really give a <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase></verse>

<verse>[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Walked in the store, what's everybody staring at?
They act like they never seen a <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> wearing black
Following a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> and shit - ain't this a bitch?
All I wanted was some chips
I wanna take my business elsewhere - but where?
’Cause who in the <phrase type="profanity">hell</phrase> cares?
About a black man with a black need
They wanna jack me like some kind of crack fiend
I wonder if he knows that my income
Is more than his pension, salary and then some
Your daughter is my number one fan
And your <phrase type="profanity">trife-ass</phrase> wife wants a life with a black man
So who's the mack, in fact who's the black jack?
Sit back and get fat off the fat cat
While he thinks that he's getting over
I bust a move as smooth as Casanova
And count another quick mill'
I'm getting paid for my trade but I'm still real
And if you look between the lines you'll find a rhyme
As strong as a <phrase type="profanity">fucking</phrase> nine
Mail stacked up, <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> wanna act up
Let's put the gats up and throw your blacks up
But the cops getting dropped by the gun shot
Used to come but he's done, now we run the block
To my brothers: stay strong keep your heads up
They know we fed up; but they just Don't Give a <phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase>

They just don't give a <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase></verse>

<outro>[Outro: 2Pac]
I gotta give my <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> offs
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the San Francisco Police Department
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the Marin County Sheriff's Department
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the FBI
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the CIA
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the B-U-S-H
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to the Ameri-K-K-Ka
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> you to all you redneck prejudice <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase>
That wanna <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with me, fuck y'all!
Punk gay sensitive little dick <phrase type="dt">bastards</phrase>
2Pacalypse <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckerin'</phrase> now
Y'all can all kiss my <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> and suck my dick
And my Uncle Tommy's balls
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> y'all
Punks (*echoes*)</outro></lyrics></song>
