         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 1: Eye-Kyu] <br /> Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm
         <br /> The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime <br /> My slick acapella
         sounds clever with the beats, boy <br /> I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit
         the streets <br /> Forget a gold digger's succubus <br /> My soul's thick with ruggedness
         <br /> With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no <span class="profanity">nigga</span>
         <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with this <br /> I got more different strokes than
         Philip Drummound <br /> On open mic I bone your women <br /> Just to keep my lyrics comin'
         <br /> We elevated to new heights, premeditated <br /> Let it be that I stated, they hate
         it <br /> Now that they see that I made itThe escalated can be put to the test of greatness
         <br /> Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it <br /> So I take it, that's the reason I'm
         hated <br /> To represent's my temperament <br /> If rap was a dick, all you so called hard
         MC's would not be impotent, but pimpin' it <br /> And actin' like you could rock a show
         <br /> Harder than LL's rock the bells, but yous a <span class="dt">hoe</span>
         <br /> Everything that you collaborate I lacerate <br /> My rhymes they keep comin' <br />
         Like nymphomaniacs that masturbate <br /> At a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your
            <span class="profanity">ass</span> to hate <br /> I blast your hate, and have you all
         runnin' master gates <br /> And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows <br /> I got
         them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose <br /> Buckin' these <span class="dt"
            >hoes</span>, I got that <span class="profanity">shit</span> down to a science <br />
         Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance <br /> Defiance? No, we won't
         have that <br /> You want your <span class="profanity">shit</span> to blow up? <br /> Well,
         I'ma stuff some dynamite in your <span class="profanity">ass</span> crack <br /> And blast
         that <span class="profanity">shit</span> to kingdom come <br /> Then bring them some of
         this real hip-hop <br /> I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run
         <br /> And you all knew from Meeko <br /> That you couldn't hold your own <br /> With the
         strength of Lou Ferrigno <br /> So, stop that <span class="profanity">bullshit</span> and
         flow, yo <br /> You need to come with the real skills and act like you know <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Hook: Eye-Kyu] <br /> Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313? <br /> None

         become me <br /> If you ever wanna be one, see <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 2: Eminem] <br /> So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313? <br /> You
         don't know shit, so when you see one, flee <br /> You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC
         <br /> I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T <br /> I'm sure you're bound to
         agree, a sweet MC crash the spot <br /> I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott
         <br /> Your <span class="profanity">ass</span> forgot, so just in case you don't remember
         me <br /> I'll run your brain round the block to jog your <span class="profanity"
            >fuckin'</span> memory <br /> It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed <br /> You
         will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed <br /> My facilities filled
         with fans, packed to capacity <br /> I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his <span
            class="profanity">ass shitty</span>
         <br /> If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner <br /> Than Jeru jackin'
         off when he showers <br /> You flowers got no clout with a thing <br /> You could date a
         stick of dynamite <br /> And wouldn't go out with a bang <br /> I shout with a slang,
         simple as ABC's <br /> Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease <br /> Dethrone
         MC's, and I'ma max alone <br /> Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone <br /> So
         facts are known, biters get treated with shots <br /> I rock a beat harder than you could
         beat it with rocks <br /> I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers <br /> You
         couldn't make the fans throw up their hands <br /> If they swallowed their fingers <br />
         But you can bring yours, let's see what you got <br /> But don't front, and never try to be
         what you're not <br /> 'Cause you can be quick <br /> Jump the candlestick, burn your back
         <br /> And <span class="profanity">fuck</span> Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack <br />
         <br />
         <br /> Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313? <br /> None of these skills you
         'bout to see come free <br /> So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me <br /> If you

         Oh, that smell? Dada must've runned over a skunk <br /> Now, I know what you're thinkin',
         it's kind of late to go swimmin' <br /> But you know your Mama, she's one of those type of
         women <br /> That do crazy things, and if she don't get her way she'll throw a fit <br />
         Don't play with Dada's toy knife, honey, let go of it! (no!) <br /> And don't look so
         upset, why you actin' bashful? <br /> Don't you wanna help Dada build a sandcastle? (yeah!)
         <br /> And Mama said she wants to show how far she can float <br /> And don't worry about
         that little boo-boo on her throat <br /> It's just a little scratch – it don't hurt <br />
         Her was eatin' dinner while you were sweepin' <br /> And spilled ketchup on her shirt
         <br /> Mama's messy, ain't she? We'll let her wash off in the water <br /> And me and you

         called prison and a place called jail <br /> And Dada's probably on his way to all of 'em
         except one <br /> ‘Cause Mama's got a new husband and a stepson <br /> And you don't want a
         brother, do ya? <br /> Maybe when you're old enough <br /> To understand a little better,
         I'll explain it to ya <br /> But for now, we'll just say Mama was real, real bad <br /> She
         was bein' mean to Dad and made him real, real <span class="emotion">mad</span>

         her to wake, but don't worry <br /> Dada made a nice bed for Mommy at the bottom of the
         lake <br /> Here, you wanna help Dada tie a rope around this rock? (yea) <br /> We'll tie

         <br />
         <br /> So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars <br /> This life as a rap star
         is nothin' without guard <br /> Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
         <br /> My attitude was "<span class="profanity">fuck</span> it," because <span
            class="profanity">motherfuckers</span> love it <br /> To be a soldier, must maintain
         composure at ease <br /> Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be <br /> Uh,

         <br /> Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, <span class="profanity">bitch</span>, I'm
         barely broke <br /> I'm smokin' <span class="profanity">bomb-ass</span> weed, feelin'

         <br /> No guts, no glory, my <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, <span class="profanity"
            >bitch</span> got the game distorted <br /> Now it's on and it's on because I said so
         <br /> Can't trust a <span class="profanity">bitch</span> in the business, <span
            class="lifeEvent">so I got with Death Row</span>
         <br /> Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious <br /> Started plottin' and
         plannin' on schemes to come and trick us <br /> But thug niggas be on point and game tight
         <br /> Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night <br /> Got problems, then handle it,

         Jumped up with a broken back <br /> Thank God I was smokin' crack <br /> All day, and doped

         her first <br /> Ran through Rally's parking lot and took a shortcut <br /> Saw the house

         the door down to murder this divorced <span class="dt">slut</span>
         <br /> Looked around the room <br /> That's when I seen her bedroom door shut <br /> I know

         well come out now <br /> She said: "Come in! It's unlocked." <br /> I walked in and all I

         whole like an egg roll <br /> With one leg left, now I'm hoppin' around crippled <br /> I
         grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple <br /> Just tryna buy me some time
         <br /> Then I remembered this magic trick <br /> Duh-dah-duh-dah-duh-duh, go-go gadget
         dick! <br /> Whipped that <span class="profanity">shit</span> out, and ain't no doubt about
         it <br /> It hit the ground, caused an earthquake and power outage <br /> I shouted: "Now,

         Got murdered in cold-blood <br /> That old saloon there was their little 'home away from
         home' <br /> They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern <br /> And on a
         quiet night, you can still hear <br /> The footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9" <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 1: Eminem] <br /> I don't speak, I float in the air, wrapped in a sheet
         <br /> I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat <br /> I translate when my
         voice is read through a seismograph <br /> And the noise is spread <br /> Picked up and
         transmitted through Royce's head <br /> Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed
         <br /> 'Til the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead <br /> Told him each
         one of his boys is dead <br /> I asked him to come to the dark side <br /> He made a choice
         and said... <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 2: Royce da 5'9"] <br /> Who hard? Yo, I done heard worse <br /> We can get
         in two cars and accelerate at each other <br /> To see which one'll swerve first <br /> Two
         blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds that of a globe on top of nine other
         planets <br /> Kissed the cheek of the Devil <br /> Intelligence level is hellier than
         treble peakin' <br /> On speakers in the ghetto <br /> Dismissal, I'm not a fair man <br />
         Disgraced the race of an atheist <br /> Interceptin' missiles with my bare hands like a
         patriot <br /> One track sliced without swords <br /> I buried the Christ corpse, in my
         past life <br /> When the black knight mounted the white horse <br /> And stay over-worked
         <br /> It's like the Nazis and the Nation <br /> Collaboratin', attemptin' to take over the
         Earth <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Hook 1: Eminem] <br /> ‘Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil <br /> And
         we hit the trees 'til we look like Vietnamese people <br /> He's Evil, and I'm Bad like
         Steve Seagal <br /> Above the law ‘cause I don't agree with police either <br /> (<span

         <br /> [Verse 1] <br /> These are the results of a thousand electric volts <br /> A neck
         with bolts (Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse!) <br /> A kid who refused to respect
         adults <br /> Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose <br /> A corny-lookin'
         white boy, scrawny and always ornery <br /> ‘Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies
         pickin' on me <br /> And I might snap, one day just like that <br /> I decided to strike
         back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack <br /> My first day in Junior High, this kid
         said: "It's you and I <br /> Three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die" <br /> I looked at
         my watch, it was 1:20 <br /> "I already gave you my lunch money! <br /> What more do you
         want from me?" <br /> He said: "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse" <br />
         My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first <br /> Somethin' told me: "Try to
         fake a stomach ache, it works!" <br /> I screamed: "Oww! My appendix feel like they could
         burst <br /> Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse" <br /> "What's the matter?" — I
         don't know, my leg, it hurts <br /> "Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy" <br /> Oh,
         I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee <br /> "Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over
         <br /> And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework" <br /> But don't you
         wanna give me after school detention? <br /> "Nah, that bully wants to beat your <span

         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 2] <br /> Way before my baby daughter Hailie <br /> I was harassed daily by
         this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey <br /> An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, ‘cause his
         father boxes <br /> So every day he'd shove me in the lockers <br /> One day he came in the
         bathroom while I was pissin' <br /> And had me in the position to beat me into submission
         <br /> He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose <br /> Soaked my clothes
         in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat <br /> I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't
         beef <br /> But he just wouldn't leave <br /> He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe
         <br /> He looked at me and said: "You gonna die, <span class="dt">honky</span>!" <br /> The
         Principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me <br /> I made them think they beat me
         to death <br /> Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left <br />
         Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth <br /> Kicked the door hinge loose
         <br /> And ripped out the four-inch screws <br /> Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and
         foreign tools <br /> This is for every time you took my orange juice <br /> Or stole my
         seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk <br /> Every time you tipped my tray and
         it dropped and spilt <br /> I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good <br /> I
         cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could <br /> And beat him over the head with
         it 'til I broke the wood <br /> Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot <br />
         Made it home later that same day <br /> Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything
         became gray <br /> I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read <br /> I went deaf and my
         left ear started to bleed <br /> My mother started screamin': "What are you on, drugs?!
         <br /> Look at you! You're gettin' blood all over my rug!" (sorry!) <br /> She beat me over
         the head with the remote control <br /> Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my
         skull <br /> I picked it up and screamed: "Look, <span class="dt">bitch</span>, what have
         you done?!" <br /> "Oh my God, I'm sorry, son!" — shut up, you <span class="dt"
         >cunt</span>! <br /> I said <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it, took it and stuck it
         back up in my head <br /> Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck <br />
         <br />

         <h5>Certification: Gold</h5>
         <br /> Featured Singer: Dave Hollister <br />
         <br /> Brenda's got a baby <br />
         <br />
         <br /> Singer: 2Pac <br />
         <br /> I hear Brenda's got a baby, <br /> but Brenda's barely got a brain <br /> A damn
         shame, the girl can hardly spell her name <br /> "That's not our problem, that's up to
         Brenda's family" <br /> Well, let me show you how it affects our whole community <br /> Now
         Brenda really never knew her moms <br /> And her dad was a junkie, puttin' death into his
         arms <br /> It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know <br /> Just 'cause you're in
         the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow <br /> But oh, that's a thought, my own revelation
         <br /> Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation <br /> Brenda got herself a boyfriend
         <br /> Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family</span>
         <br /> Who really didn't care to see, or give a <span class="lifeEvent">damn</span> if she
         <br /> Went out and had a church of kids <br /> As long as when the check came they got
         first dibs <br /> Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger <br /> But no one seems to notice any
         change in her figure <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby</span>
         <br /> In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy <br /> And yet and she thinks that
         he'll be with her forever <br /> And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
         Whatever, <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">he left her and she had the baby solo</span>
         <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent"> She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so</span>
         <br /> She didn't know what to throw away and what to keep <br /> She wrapped the baby up
         and threw him in a trash heap <br /> I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the
         cries <br /> She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes <br /> Now the baby's
         in the trash heap, bawlin' <br /> Momma can't help her, but it hurt to hear her callin'
         <br /> Brenda wants to run away <br /> Momma say you makin' me lose pay <br /> There's
         social workers here every day <br /> Now Brenda's gotta make her own way <br /> Can't go to
         her family, they won't let her stay <br /> No money, no babysitter, she couldn't keep a job <br />
         <span class="lifeEvent">She tried to sell crack but end up gettin' robbed</span>
         <br /> So now, what's next? There ain't nothin' left to sell <br /> So she sees sex as a
         way of leavin' hell <br /> It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain <br />
         Prostitute, found slain, and Brenda's her name She's got a baby <br />

         the end <br /> ‘Cause I don't give a <span class="profanity">fuck</span>, like my middle
         finger was stuck <br /> And I was wavin' it at everybody, screaming, "I suck!" <br /> I go
         on stage in front of a sell-out crowd <br /> And yell out loud: "All y'all get the <span
            class="profanity">hell</span> out now!" <br />

         Eminem, this is your record release party!) <br /> I'm bored out of my gourd, so I took a

         <br /> Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket <br /> One Excedrin tablet short of a

         lipstick <br /> Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick <br /> Made a couple of

         friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I like happy things, I'm really calm and peaceful <br /> I like birds, bees, I like
         people <br /> I like funny things that make me happy and gleeful <br /> Like when my
         teacher sucked my wee-wee in preschool <br /> The ill type, I stab myself with a steel
         spike <br /> While I blow my brain out just to see what it feels like <br /> ‘Cause this is
         how I am in real life <br /> I don't want to just die a normal death <br /> I wanna be
         killed twice <br /> How you gonna scare somebody with a gun threat <br /> When they high
         off of drugs they haven't even done yet? <br /> So bring the money by tonight, ‘cause your
         wife <br /> Said this the biggest knife she ever saw in her life (help me!) <br /> I try to
         keep it positive and play it cool <br /> Shoot up the playground and tell the kids to stay
         in school ("Stay in school!") <br /> ‘Cause I'm the one they can relate to and look up to
         better <br /> Tonight I think I'll write my biggest fan a <span class="profanity"
            >fuck-you</span> letter <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I got mushrooms, I got acid <br /> I got tabs and aspirin tablets <br /> I'm your
         brother when you need <br /> Some good weed to set you free <br /> You know me, I'm your
         friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I listen to your demo tape <br /> And act like I don't like it ("Ahh, that <span
            class="profanity">shit</span> is wack!") <br /> Six months later you hear your lyrics on
         my <span class="profanity">shit</span>
         <br /> ("That's my <span class="profanity">shit</span>!") <br /> People don't buy <span
            class="profanity">shit</span> no more, they just dub it <br /> That's why I'm still
         broke and had the number-one club hit <br /> But they love it when you make your business
         public <br /> So <span class="profanity">fuck</span> it, I've got herpes while we on the
         subject (uh-huh) <br /> And if I told you I had AIDS, y'all would play it <br /> ‘Cause you
         stupid <span class="profanity">mothafuckas</span> think I'm playin' when I say it <br />
         Well, I do take pills, don't do speed <br /> Don't do crack, don't do coke, I do smoke weed
         <br /> Don't do smack, I do do shrooms, do drink beer <br /> I just wanna make a few things
         clear <br /> My baby mama's not dead, she's still alive and <span class="profanity"
            >bitchin'</span>
         <br /> And I don't have herpes, my dick's just itchin' <br /> It's not syphilis, and as for
         being AIDS-infested <br /> I don't know yet, I'm too scared to get tested <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I got mushrooms, I got acid <br /> I got tabs and aspirin tablets <br /> I'm your
         brother when you need <br /> Some good weed to set you free <br /> You know me, I'm your
         friend <br /> When you need a Mini Thin <br /> (I'm Slim Shady…) I'm Shady! <br />
         <br />
         <br /> Told you I was Shady <br /> Y'all didn't believe me <br /> I'm Shady! <br /> And
         that's my name <br />

         like a big obstacle <br /> Put in front of your optical to slow you down <br /> And every
         time you think you've gotten past it <br /> It's gonna come back around <br /> And tackle
         you to the <span class="profanity">damn</span> ground <br /> What are friends? <br />
         Friends are people that you think are your friends <br /> But they're really your enemies,
         with secret identities <br /> And disguises to hide their true colors <br /> So just when
         you think you're close enough to be brothers <br /> They wanna come back <br /> And cut
         your throat when you ain't lookin' <br /> What is money? <br /> Money is what makes a man
         act funny <br /> Money is the root of all evil <br /> Money'll make them same friends come
         back around <br /> Swearin' that they was always down <br /> What is life? I'm tired of
         life <br />
         <br />
         <br /> I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins <br /> I'm tired of
         committin' so many sins <br /> Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins
         <br /> Tired of never havin' any ends <br /> Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on
         crack and Mini Thins <br /> I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins <br />
         Tired of not havin' a deal <br /> Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without
         grabbin' a steel <br /> Tired of drownin' in my sorrow <br /> Tired of havin' to borrow a

         <br /> I'm tired of jobs startin' off <br /> At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why
         I'm smartin' off <br /> I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough <br /> Tired
         of havin' to work as a gas station clerk <br /> For this jerk, breathin' down my neck,
         drivin' me berserk <br /> I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware <br /> Tired of workin' at
         Builder's Square <br /> Tired of not bein' a millionaire <br />

         <br /> But if I had a million dollars <br /> I'd buy a <span class="profanity">damn</span>
         brewery and turn the planet into alcoholics <br /> If I had a magic wand <br /> I'd make
         the world suck my dick without a condom on <br /> While I'm on the john <br /> If I had a
         million bucks, it wouldn't be enough <br /> Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks

         kiss <br />
         <br />

         Me" <br /> And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs <br /> Tired of JLB sayin', "where

         <br />
         <br /> [Eye-Kyu] <br /> It's a broke day, but everything is okay <br /> I'm up all night,
         but everything is alright <br /> It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep <br />
         It's a long year, pretendin' I belong here <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Eminem] <br /> One day I plan to be a family man, happily married <br /> I want to
         grow to be so old that I have to be carried <br /> 'Til I'm glad to be buried, and leave
         this crazy world <br /> And have at least a half a million for my baby girl <br /> It may
         be early to be plannin' this stuff <br /> 'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man,
         and it's tough <br /> 'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough <br /> I've
         been taken advantage of <br /> Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been cuffedBut I don't
         panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up <br /> The minute <span

         nothin' <br /> I've been troubled enough and <br /> I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'
         <br /> See, my destiny's to rest at ease <br /> 'Til I'm impressed and pleased <br /> With
         my progress I won't settle for less than cheese <br /> I'm on a quest to seize all, my own
         label to call <br /> Way before my baby is able to crawl <br /> I'm too stable to fall, the
         pressure motivates <br /> To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades
         <br /> I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth <br /> Where they don't pull a weapon on

         in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheep <br /> Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a
         waterin' mouth <br /> Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse <br /> In this
         slaughterin' house <br /> Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil <br /> I've seen it
         turn beautiful people crude and deceitful <br /> And make them do <span class="profanity"
            >shit</span> illegal for these Grants and Jacksons <br /> These transactions explain a
         man's actions <br /> But in the midst of this insanity, I found my ChristianityThrough God
         and there's a wish he granted me <br /> He showed me how to cope with the stress <br /> And
         hope for the best, instead of mope and <span class="emotion">depressed</span>
         <br /> Always gropin' a mess of flyin' over the nest <br /> To sellin' dope with the rest
         <br /> I quit smokin' cess to open my chest <br /> Life is stressful inside this cesspool
         <br /> Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel <br /> My little brother's tryin' to
         learn his mathematics <br /> He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack
         addicts <br /> Kids attract static, children with automatics <br /> Takin' target practice
         on teens for Starter jackets <br /> I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum <br />
         I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum <br /> It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do
         well on this Earth <br /> But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth <br />

         <h5>Certification: Gold</h5>[Intro: Maxine and Denuan Porter] <br /> Maxine! <br /> Hello
         <br /> Can I speak to Maxine? <br /> Yeah, this is me, what's up? <br /> What up? <br />
         Who dis? <br /> Denaun <br /> Yeah, what's up? <br /> What are you doing? <br /> Nothing,
         just laying in bed <br /> Huh? <br /> Nothing, just laying in bed <br /> Why? <br /> I
         don't know, thinking about something freaky to do <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 1: Eminem] <br /> I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine <br />
         She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean <br /> Plus she got a sugar daddy
         <br /> Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly <br /> If you mistook her,
         sadly, on her reputation <br /> You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation
         <br /> When you stepped away, son, she got her face done <br /> Lookin' provocative, she'll
         let you knock it if <br /> You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you <br /> If you
         match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice <br /> But when you catch the lice,
         or get the urgency <br /> To go to the emergency ‘cause it burns to pee <br /> Don't bring
         your germs to me, ‘cause I ain't tryna hear it <br /> While you're fightin' your <span
            class="profanity">fuckin'</span> disease, tryna clear it <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 2: Kon Artis] <br /> Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life? <br />
         That is to get with every brother <br /> And unveil one of his kids <br />
         <span class="profanity">Shit</span>, you livin' trife <br /> Got three kids at home, and
         club-hoppin' every night <br /> You say it's gonna stop <br /> But it just… slows… down…
         <br /> And then speeds back to a regular pace <br /> There is no end to this <br />
         Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be <br /> You say you wanna be with me, but how
         can you say thatWhen you got <span class="profanity">niggas</span> hidin' in your closet?
         <br /> I refrain from gettin' <span class="emotion">angry</span>
         <br /> But you keep on actin' strangely <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Verse 3: 3] <br /> I met this girl last week <br /> She was a <span
            class="profanity">freak</span>, and she liked me <br /> So I stepped on it and then
         asked my homies <br /> And chilled on the side and then watched they <span
            class="profanity">niggas</span>
         <br /> Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number <br /> I stepped to her,
         first I cleared my throat <br /> And said: "Hey, <span class="dt">bitch</span>, haven't I
         seen you before?" <br /> Looked at my <span class="profanity">nigga</span>, turned around
         and got slapped <br /> Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?" <br /> She said
         she just broke up with her <span class="profanity">nigga</span> and <span class="profanity"
            >shit</span>
         <br /> She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and <span class="profanity"
            >shit</span>
         <br /> She said her name was Maxine <br /> So I told her I wanted her number <br /> She
         asked could I give her mine too <br /> Got to the crib and called her up <br /> We got into
         a good conversation <br /> That's when she asked me could I fuck <br /> I said: "Maxine,
         check this out <br /> Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out." <br /> Got
         to the crib, she let me in <br /> She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand <br /> And
         proceeded to the bedroom <br /> I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things"
         <br /> What the <span class="profanity">fuck</span> are you doin'? <br /> So I went for my
         protection <br /> Took off my clothes and started flexin' <br /> As she went for my
         midsection <br /> I threw her down as I tore off her shirt <br /> Pulled out my jimmy and I
         thought about puttin' in work <br /> Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad <br /> But
         there's somethin' that I gotta tell your <span class="profanity">ass</span>." <br /> I said
         "What is it? Another <span class="profanity">nigga</span>? It's okay." <br /> She said: "No
         I forgot to tell you <br /> That I got AIDS, I got a problem." <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Outro: Maxine and Denaun Porter] <br /> Hey, Maxine <br /> What? <br /> You
         thinkin' about suckin' my dick? <br /> Yeah, for a small price <br /> For a small price?
         What you mean? <br /> You know, money, <span class="profanity">nigga</span>
         <br /> You don't need no damn money; I can't give you no money anyways, I heard you got
         some <span class="profanity">shit</span>
         <br /> What you, what you hear I got? <br /> AIDS <br /> Who told you that <span
            class="profanity">bullshit</span>? <br /> My <span class="profanity">nigga</span> Kyu,
         he wouldn't lie <br /> Well, if that's the case, Kyu got it then <br /> Oh for real, it's
         like that? <br /> Well, I ain't got <span class="profanity">shit</span>, so he ain't got
            <span class="profanity">shit</span>
         <br /> And if he do, he ain't get that <span class="profanity">shit</span> from me <br /> I
         ain't <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span> around with no third <span class="profanity"
            >nigga</span>
         <br />
         <span class="profanity">Fuck</span> that, I ain't <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span>
         with you <br /> No, see… <br /> You got that <span class="profanity">shit</span>, I ain't
         gotta <span class="profanity">fuck</span> with you <br /> Hold on, why it ain't even like
         that <br /> I want y'all to get paid, <span class="profanity">fuckin'</span>

         take pills, drop out of school, kill people <br /> And drink, jump behind the wheel like it
         was still legal <br /> I'm dumb enough to walk in a store and steal <br /> So I'm dumb
         enough to ask for a date with Lauryn Hill <br /> Some people only see that I'm white,
         ignorin' skill <br /> ‘Cause I stand out like a green hat with a orange bill <br /> But I
         don't get pissed, y'all don't even see through the mist <br /> How the <span
            class="profanity">fuck</span> can I be white? I don't even exist <br /> I get a clean
         shave, bathe, go to a rave <br /> Die from an overdose and dig myself up out of my grave
         <br /> My middle finger won't go down, how do I wave? <br /> And this is how I'm supposed
         to teach kids how to behave? <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Hook 1] <br /> Now follow me and do exactly what you see <br /> Don't you wanna
         grow up to be just like me? <br /> I slap women and eat shrooms then OD <br /> Now don't
         you want to grow up to be just like me? <br />
         <br />
         <br /> Me and Marcus Allen went over to see Nicole <br /> When we heard a knock at the
         door, must've been Ron Gold <br /> Jumped behind the door, put the orgy on hold <br />
         Killed them both, then smeared blood on the white Bronco <br /> (We did it!) My mind won't
         work if my spine don't jerk <br /> I slapped Garth Brooks out of his rhinestone shirt
         <br /> I'm not a player, just a ill rhyme sayer <br /> That'll spray a aerosol can up at
         the ozone layer <br /> My rap style's warped, I'm running out the morgue <br /> With your
         dead grandmother's corpse to throw it on your porch <br /> Jumped in a Chickenhawk cartoon
         with a cape on <br /> And beat up Foghorn Leghorn with an acorn <br /> I'm 'bout as normal
         as Norman Bates with deformative traits <br /> A premature birth that was four minutes late
         <br /> Mother, are you there? I love you <br /> I never meant to hit you over the head with
         that shovel <br /> Will someone please explain to my brain <br /> That I just severed the
         main vein with a chainsaw and I'm in pain? <br /> I take a breather and sigh; either I'm
         high <br /> Or I'm nuts, ‘cause if you ain't tilting this room, neither am I <br /> So when
         you see your mom with a thermometer <br /> Shoved in her <span class="profanity"
         >ass</span>, then it probably is obvious I got it on with her <br /> ‘Cause when I drop
         this solo <span class="profanity">shit</span>, it's over with <br /> I bought Cage's tape,
         opened it, and dubbed over it <br />
         <br />
         <br /> [Hook 2] <br /> I came to the club drunk with a fake ID <br /> Don't you wanna grow
         up to be just like me? <br /> I've been with ten women who got HIV <br /> Now don't you
         wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I got genital warts and it burns when I pee <br />
         Don't you wanna grow up to be just like me? <br /> I tie a rope around my penis and jump
         from a tree <br /> You probably wanna grow up to be just like me <br />
         <br />

         thugs, smugglin' drugs <br /> Jugglin' jobs, guzzlin' jugs <br /> So here's a toast to
         federal checks <br /> Hetero sex, unaffordable medical debts <br /> We travel in packs,
         unravelin' facts <br /> And gravel in cracks to find babblin' max, gafflin' tracks <br /> I
         grapple an axe for them bafflin' acts <br /> Of mysterious stab-in-the-backs who dabble in
         wax <br /> Stealin' my art when I sculpt it <br /> The culprit that stole <span

         hatchet, I carry the fat <span class="profanity">shit</span>
         <br /> Butterfingers is here when it's necessary to scratch it <br /> Baby, all I wanna do
         is swallow one or two <br /> Smoke a little bit and follow one of you <br /> Back home when
         the party ends <br /> So tonight I'm droppin' naughty hints <br /> To the finest women in

         <br /> Ayo, biters are like tarantulas, vandalous <br /> Livin' as scandalous as a
         television evangelist <br /> But I can handle this; I'm the rhyme biter, crime fighter
         <br /> Caped crusader, takin' care of undeservin' lime lighters <br /> I think we live in
         era meant for me <br /> Experimentally I found a way to spread the terror mentally <br />
         When I stumbled upon this resolution <br /> By usin' a special fusion <br /> Of chemical
         solution for this fresh illusion <br /> You couldn't see me with binoculars <br /> I'm
         armed like an octopus <br /> Step on stage and you'll get socked and pushed <br /> Talkin'
         that junk like you had Black Bart at your back <br /> Come to battle me and you get smacked
         hard as you act <br /> When I rep-a-resent it, and will have a referee in it <br /> Every
         minute, so when I win it you never resent it <br /> I'm forever demented <br /> Come up
         with funk, I'll never be scented <br /> You got the point when I cleverly sent it <br />
         <br />
         <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> We don't wanna fight <br /> We don't
         want no one feelin' uptight <br /> ’Cause we came here to do this tonight <br /> ’Til the

         <br /> Eminem is headed skyward <br /> For those who thought that I would <br /> Make you
         bored and treat you like a piece of plywood <br /> I've got miracle lyrical capability all
         in me <br /> With the agility to escape a killer bee colony <br /> So get your cameras and
         capture how miraculous <br /> I rap for all you Draculas <br /> And showed you all how wack
         you was <br /> I meant it as a diss <br /> ‘Cause you don't posses the pizazz of this
         <br /> I'm hazardous enough already as it is <br /> Without you addin' fuel to the fire;
         I'm cruel to the liar <br /> Who fails to recognize my reign and hail rule to the sire
         <br /> Clinical studies show that I'm cynicalThere's no one who's identical <br /> To my
         fresh and authentic flow <br /> I'm sure the party people can agree <br /> That I'm
         enchantin' rhythm romantically <br /> Freakin' vocals so frantically <br /> So throw your
         hands up in the atmosphere <br /> And let them know the only party that was phat was here <br />
