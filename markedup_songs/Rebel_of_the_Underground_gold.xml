    <lyrics>
        <intro>
            <line>Rebel ... rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel ... rebel</line>
        </intro>

        <verse>
            <line>They just can't stand the reign, or the occasional pain</line>
            <line>From a man like me, who goes against the grain</line>
            <line>Sometimes I do it in vain</line>
            <line>So with a little bass and treble</line>
            <line>Hey mister, it's time for me to explain that I'm the rebel</line>
            <line>Cold as the devil</line>
            <line>Straight from the underground, the rebel, a lower level</line>
            <line>They came to see the maniac psychopath</line>
            <line>The critics heard of me, and the aftermath</line>
            <line>I don't give a <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase> and it shows</line>
            <line>And when I do a stage show I wear street clothes</line>
            <line>So they all know me</line>
            <line>The lyrical lunatic, the maniac MC</line>
            <line>I give a shout out to your homies</line>
            <line>And maybe then, the critics'll leave your boy alone, G</line>
            <line>On the streets or on TV</line>
            <line>It just don't pay to be, a truth tellin' MC</line>
            <line>They won't be <phrase type="emotion">happy</phrase> 'til I'm banned</line>
            <line>The most dangerous weapon: an educated black man</line>
            <line>So point blank in your face</line>
            <line>Pump up the bass, and join the human race</line>
            <line>I throw peace to The Bay</line>
            <line>Cause from The Jungle to Oaktown, they backin' me up all the way</line>
            <line>You know you gotta love the sound</line>
            <line>It's from the rebel - the rebel of the underground</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>Now I'm face to face with the devils</line>
            <line>Cause they breedin' more rebels than the whole <phrase type="profanity"
                    >damn</phrase> ghetto</line>
            <line>And police brutality</line>
            <line><phrase type="profanity">Shit</phrase>, it put you in the nip and call it
                technicality</line>
            <line>So you reap what you sow</line>
            <line>So reap the wrath of the rebel, jackin' 'em up once mo'</line>
            <line>Now the fox is in the henhouse</line>
            <line>Creepin' up on your daughter while you sleep I got her sneakin' out</line>
            <line>2Pac ain't nothin' nice, I'll be nothin' how I wanna</line>
            <line>And doin' what I'm gonna</line>
            <line>Now I'm up to no good</line>
            <line>The mastermind of mischief movin' more than most could</line>
            <line>So sit and slip into the sound</line>
            <line>Peep the rebel - the rebel of the underground</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
            <line>Rebel, he's a rebel</line>
            <line>Rebel of the underground</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>They say they hate me, they wanna hold me down</line>
            <line>I guess they <phrase type="emotion">scared</phrase> of the rebel - the rebel of
                the underground</line>
            <line>But I never let it get me</line>
            <line>I just make another record 'bout the punks tryin' to sweat me</line>
            <line>In fact, they tryin' to keep me out</line>
            <line>Try to censor what I say</line>
            <line>Cause they don't like what I'm talkin' 'bout</line>
            <line>So what's wrong with the media today</line>
            <line>Got brothers sellin' out cause they greedy to get paid</line>
            <line>But me, I'm comin' from the soul</line>
            <line>And if it don't go gold, my story still gettin' told</line>
            <line>And that way they can't stop me</line>
            <line>And if it sells a couple of copies, the punks'll try to copy</line>
            <line>It's sloppy, don't even try to</line>
            <line>I'm a slave to the rhythm, and I'm about to fly through</line>
            <line>So, yo, to the people in the ghetto</line>
            <line>When ya hear the bass flow, go ahead and let go</line>
            <line>Now everybody wanna gangbang</line>
            <line>They talkin' street slang, but the punks still can't hang</line>
            <line>They makin' records 'bout violence</line>
            <line>But when it comes to the real, some brothers go silent</line>
            <line>It kinda make you wanna think about</line>
            <line>That ya gotta do some sellin' out, just to get your record out</line>
            <line>But 2Pacalypse is straight down</line>
            <line>So feel the wrath of the rebel - the rebel of the underground</line>
