<verse><line>[Verse 1]</line>
<line>These are the results of a thousand electric volts</line>
<line>A neck with bolts (Nurse, we're losin' him, check the pulse!)</line>
<line>A kid who refused to respect adults</line>
<line>Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose</line>
<line>A corny-lookin' white boy, scrawny and always ornery</line>
<line>‘Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin' on me</line>
<line>And I might snap, one day just like that</line>
<line>I decided to strike back, and flatten every tire on the bike rack</line>
<line>My first day in Junior High, this kid said: "It's you and I</line>
<line>Three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"</line>
<line>I looked at my watch, it was 1:20</line>
<line>"I already gave you my lunch money!</line>
<line>What more do you want from me?"</line>
<line>He said: "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse"</line>
<line>My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first</line>
<line>Somethin' told me: "Try to fake a stomach ache, it works!"</line>
<line>I screamed: "Oww! My appendix feel like they could burst</line>
<line>Teacher, teacher! Quick, I need a naked nurse"</line>
<line>"What's the matter?" — I don't know, my leg, it hurts</line>
<line>"Leg? I thought you said it was your tummy"</line>
<line>Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee</line>
<line>"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over</line>
<line>And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework"</line>
<line>But don't you wanna give me after school detention?</line>
<line>"Nah, that bully wants to beat your <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> and I'ma let him"</line></verse>

<chorus><line>[Hook]</line>
<line>Brain damage, ever since the day I was born</line>
<line>Drugs is what they used to say I was on</line>
<line>They say I never knew which way I was goin'</line>
<line>But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song</line>
<line>Brain damage, ever since the day I was born</line>
<line>Drugs is what they used to say I was on</line>
<line>They say I never knew which way I was goin'</line>
<line>But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song</line></chorus>

<verse><line>[Verse 2]</line>
<line>Way before my baby daughter Hailie</line>
<line>I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey</line>
<line>An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, ‘cause his father boxes</line>
<line>So every day he'd shove me in the lockers</line>
<line>One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin'</line>
<line>And had me in the position to beat me into submission</line>
<line>He banged my head against the urinal 'til he broke my nose</line>
<line>Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat</line>
<line>I tried to plead and tell him we shouldn't beef</line>
<line>But he just wouldn't leave</line>
<line>He kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe</line>
<line>He looked at me and said: "You gonna die, <phrase type="dt">honky</phrase>!"</line>
<line>The Principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me</line>
<line>I made them think they beat me to death</line>
<line>Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left</line>
<line>Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth</line>
<line>Kicked the door hinge loose</line>
<line>And ripped out the four-inch screws</line>
<line>Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms and foreign tools</line>
<line>This is for every time you took my orange juice</line>
<line>Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk</line>
<line>Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt</line>
<line>I'm gettin' you back, bully, now once and for good</line>
<line>I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could</line>
<line>And beat him over the head with it 'til I broke the wood</line>
<line>Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot</line>
<line>Made it home later that same day</line>
<line>Started readin' a comic, and suddenly everything became gray</line>
<line>I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read</line>
<line>I went deaf and my left ear started to bleed</line>
<line>My mother started screamin': "What are you on, drugs?!</line>
<line>Look at you! You're gettin' blood all over my rug!" (sorry!)</line>
<line>She beat me over the head with the remote control</line>
<line>Opened a hole and my whole brain fell out of my skull</line>
<line>I picked it up and screamed: "Look, <phrase type="dt">bitch</phrase>, what have you done?!"</line>
<line>"Oh my God, I'm sorry, son!" — shut up, you <phrase type="dt">cunt</phrase>!</line>
<line>I said <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> it, took it and stuck it back up in my head</line>
<line>Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck</line></verse>

<chorus><line>[Hook]</line>
<line>Brain damage, ever since the day I was born</line>
<line>Drugs is what they used to say I was on</line>
<line>They say I never knew which way I was goin'</line>
<line>But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song</line>
<line>Brain damage, ever since the day I was born</line>
<line>Drugs is what they used to say I was on</line>
<line>They say I never knew which way I was goin'</line>
<line>But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song</line></chorus>
<outro>
<line>[Outro]</line>
<line>Brain damage, it's brain damage</line>
<line>I got brain damage, it's brain damage</line>
<line>It's probably brain damage, it's brain damage</line>
<line>Brain damage, I got brain damage</line></outro></lyrics>
