<song><title>"California Love"</title>
(feat. Dr. Dre, Roger Troutman)

<featuredSinger p="Troutman">[Roger Troutman:]</featuredSinger>
<chorus>California love
California knows how to party
California knows how to party
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'</chorus>

<verse><featuredSinger p="Dre">[Dr. Dre:]</featuredSinger>
Now let me welcome everybody to the wild, wild west
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state with the <profanity>bomb-ass</profanity> hemp beat
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines serving fiends
I been in the game for 10 years making rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearing Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shining, looking like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city making pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way
Dre putting it down for Californ-i-a</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger p="Troutman">[Roger Troutman:]</featuredSinger>
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'</chorus>

<featuredSinger p="Troutman">[Roger Troutman:]</featuredSinger>
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

<verse><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
Out on bail, fresh out of jail, California dreaming
Soon as I step on the scene, I'm hearing hoochies screaming
Fiending for money and alcohol
The life of a Westside player where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot not rally to live and die
In L.A. we wearing Chucks not Ballys (yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossing, but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we program
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumping and grinding like a slow jam, it's Westside
So you know the row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down
Give me love!</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Roger Troutman:]</featuredSinger>
California knows how to party
California knows how to party (Yes, they do)
In the city of L.A
In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin'
</chorus>
[Dr. Dre:] South Central
[2Pac:] Uh, that's right
[Dr. Dre:] Now make it shake

<outro><featuredSinger p="Troutman">[Roger Troutman:]</featuredSinger>
Shake, shake it, baby
Shake, shake it, mama
Shake it Cali, shake it shake it baby
Shake it, shake it, shake it, shake it

<featuredSinger p="Dre">[Dr. Dre:]</featuredSinger>
Shake it Cali
Uh, uh, West Coast
Uh, yeah, uh, uh, Long Beach in the house
Uh, yeah, Oaktown, Oakland definitely in the house
Frisco, Frisco

<singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
And you know L.A. up in here

<featuredSinger p="Dre">[Dr. Dre:]</featuredSinger>
Pasadena where you at?
Yeah, Inglewood
Inglewood always up to no good

<singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
Even Hollywood trying to get a piece, baby

<featuredSinger p="Dre">[Dr. Dre:]</featuredSinger>
Sacramento, Sacramento where you at?

<singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
Throw it up ya'll, throw it up, throw it up!
I can't see ya
Let's show these fools how we do it over on this West Side
Cause you and I know it's the best side
Yeah, that's right
West coast, west coast</outro></song>
