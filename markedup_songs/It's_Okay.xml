            <line>It's a rough week, and I don't get enough sleep</line>

            <line>One day I plan to be a family man, happily married</line>
            <line>I want to grow to be so old that I have to be carried</line>
            <line>'Til I'm <phrase type="emotion">glad</phrase> to be buried, and leave this crazy world</line>
            <line>And have at least a half a million for my baby girl</line>
            <line>It may be early to be plannin' this stuff</line>
            <line>'Cause I'm still strugglin' hard to be the man, and it's tough</line>
            <line>'Cause man, it's been rough, but still I manage enough</line>
            <line>I've been taken advantage of</line>
            <line><phrase type="lifeEvent">Damaged and scuffed, my hands have been
                cuffed</phrase></line>
            <line>But I don't panic and huff, frantic and puff, or plan to give up</line>
            <line>The minute <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> hits the fan, it erupts</line>
            <line>I'm antein' up, double or nothin'</line>
            <line>I've been troubled enough and</line>
            <line>I'm sick of strugglin' and sufferin'</line>
            <line>See, my destiny's to rest at ease</line>
            <line>'Til I'm impressed and pleased</line>
            <line>With my progress I won't settle for less than cheese</line>
            <line>I'm on a quest to seize all, my own label to call</line>
            <line>Way before my baby is able to crawl</line>
            <line>I'm too stable to fall, the pressure motivates</line>
            <line>To know I hold the weight of boulders on my shoulder blades</line>
            <line>I see the golden gates to Heaven on Earth</line>
            <line>Where they don't pull a weapon on you</line>
            <line>When you're steppin' on turf, Kyu</line>

            <singer>Eminem</singer>> <line>I'm goin' for broke, gamblin' and playin' for
                keeps</line>
            <line>Every day in the streets, scramblin' and payin' for cheep</line>
            <line>Prayin' for sleep, dreamin' with a waterin' mouth</line>
            <line>Wishin' for a better life for my daughter and spouse</line>
            <line>In this slaughterin' house</line>
            <line>Caught up in bouts with the root of all evil</line>
            <line>I've seen it turn beautiful people crude and deceitful</line>
            <line>And make them do <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> illegal for these Grants
                and Jacksons</line>
            <line>These transactions explain a man's actions</line>

            <line>He showed me how to cope with the stress</line>

            <line>To sellin' dope with the rest</line>
            <line>I quit smokin' cess to open my chest</line>
            <line>Life is stressful inside this cesspool</line>
            <line>Tryin' to wrestle, I almost bust a blood vessel</line>
            <line>My little brother's tryin' to learn his mathematics</line>
            <line>He's asthmatic, runnin' home from school away from crack addicts</line>
            <line>Kids attract static, children with automatics</line>
            <line>Takin' target practice on teens for Starter jackets</line>
            <line>I'm usin' smarter tactics to overcome this slum</line>
            <line>I won't become as dumb as some and succumb to scum</line>
            <line>It's cumbersome, I'm tryin' to do well on this Earth</line>
            <line>But it's been hell on this Earth since I fell on this Earth</line>
