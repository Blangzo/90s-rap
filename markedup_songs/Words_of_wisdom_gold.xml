    <lyrics>
        <intro>
            <line>Killing us one by one</line>
            <line>In one way or another</line>
            <line>America will find a way to eliminate the problem</line>
            <line>One by one</line>
            <line>The problem is the troublesome black youth of the ghetto's</line>
            <line>And one by one</line>
            <line>We are being wiped off the face of this earth</line>
            <line>At an extremly alarming rate</line>
            <line>And even more alarming is the fact</line>
            <line>That we are not fighting back</line>
            <line>Brothers, sisters, <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase></line>
            <line>When I say "<phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>" it is not the <phrase
                    type="profanity">nigga</phrase> we have grown to fear</line>
            <line>It is not the <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> we say as if it has no
                meaning</line>
            <line>But to me it means Never Ignorant Getting Goals Accomplished, <phrase
                    type="profanity">nigga</phrase></line>
            <line><phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase>, what are we going to do?</line>
            <line>Walk blind into a line or fight</line>
            <line>Fight and die if we must die, like <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase></line>
        </intro>

        <verse>
            <line>This is for the masses, the lower classes</line>
            <line>The ones you left out, jobs were giving, better living</line>
            <line>But we were kept out</line>
            <line>Made to feel inferior, but we're superior</line>
            <line>Break the chains in our brains that made us fear ya</line>
            <line>Pledge allegiance to a flag that neglects us</line>
            <line>Honour a man that that refuses to respect us</line>
            <line>Emancipation Proclamation? Please!</line>
            <line>Lincoln just said that to save the nation</line>
            <line>These are lies that we all accepted</line>
            <line>Say no to drugs but the governments' kept it</line>
            <line>Running through our community, killing the unity</line>
            <line>The war on drugs is a war on you and me</line>
            <line>And yet, they say this is the Home of The Free</line>
            <line>But if you ask me, it's all about hypocrisy</line>
            <line>The constitution, yo, it don't apply to me</line>
            <line>And Lady Liberty? Stupid <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> lied to me</line>
            <line>This made me strong, and no one's gonna like what I'm pumpin'</line>
            <line>But its wrong to keep someone from learning something</line>
            <line>So get up, its time to start nation building</line>
            <line>I'm fed up, we gotta start teach the children</line>
            <line>That they can be all that they wanna to be</line>
            <line>There's much more to life than just poverty</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>This is definitely uh... words of wisdom</line>
            <line>AMERICA! AMERICA! AMERIK-K-KA</line>
            <line>I charge you with the crime of rape, murder, and assault</line>
            <line>For suppressing and punishing my people</line>
            <line>I charge you with robbery for robbing me of my history</line>
            <line>I charge you with false imprisonment for keeping me</line>
            <line>Trapped in the projects</line>
            <line>And the jury finds you guilty on all accounts</line>
            <line>And you are to serve the consequences of your evil schemes</line>
            <line>Prosecutor, do you have any more evidence?</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>Words of Wisdom</line>
            <line>Based upon the strength of a nation</line>
            <line>Conquer the enemy armed with education</line>
            <line>Protect yourself, reach for what you want to do</line>
            <line>Know thyself, teach by what we've been through</line>
            <line>Armed with the knowledge of the place we've been</line>
            <line>No one will ever oppress this race again</line>
            <line>No Malcolm X in my history text, why's that?</line>
            <line>’Cause he tried to educate and liberate all blacks</line>
            <line>Why is Martin Luther King in my book each week?</line>
            <line>He told blacks, if they get smacked, turn the other cheek</line>
            <line>I don't get it, so many questions went through my mind</line>
            <line>I get sweated, they act like asking questions is a crime</line>
            <line>But forget it, cause one day I'm gonna prove them wrong</line>
            <line>Not every brother had his mother on the welfare line</line>
            <line>The American Dream, though it seems like it's attainable</line>
            <line>They're pulling your sleeve, don't believe</line>
            <line>’Cause it will strangle ya</line>
            <line>Pulling the life of your brain, I can't explain</line>
            <line>Beg as you can obtain from which you came</line>
            <line>Swear that your mother is living in equality</line>
            <line>Forgetting your brother that's living in poverty</line>
            <line>Thought they had us beaten when they took out King</line>
            <line>But the battle ain't over till the black man sings</line>
            <line>Words of Wisdom</line>
            <line>The battle ain't over 'till the black man sings</line>
            <line>Words of Wisdom</line>

        <outro>
            <line>NIGHTMARE! That's what I am</line>
            <line>America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>I am what you made me</line>
            <line>The hate and the evil that you gave me</line>
            <line>I shine as a reminder of what you've done to my people</line>
            <line>For four hundred plus years</line>
            <line>You should be scared</line>
            <line>You should be running</line>
            <line>You should be trying to silence me</line>
            <line>Ha, but you can not escape fate</line>
            <line>For it is my turn to come</line>
            <line>Just as you rose you will fall</line>
            <line>By my hands</line>
            <line>America, you reap what you sow</line>
            <line>2Pacalypse, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>Ice Cube and Da Lynch Mob, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>Above The Law, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>Paris, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>Public Enemy, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>KRS-One, America's Nightmare</line>
            <line>New Afrikan Panthers, America's nightmare</line>
