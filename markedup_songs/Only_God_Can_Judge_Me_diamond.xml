            <line>Only God can judge me (that right?)</line>
            <line>Only God can judge me now</line>
            <line>Nobody else (nobody else)</line>
            <line>All you other <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> get out my business

            <line>Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back</line>
            <line>I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats</line>
            <line>Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed</line>
            <line>And hocus pocus, I try to focus, but I can't see</line>
            <line>And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time</line>
            <line>Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me</line>
            <line>Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?</line>
            <line>Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use of tryin'</line>
            <line>I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed</line>
            <line>And fantasies of my family in a hearse</line>
            <line>And they say it's the White man I should fear</line>
            <line>But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here</line>
            <line>I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side</line>
            <line><phrase type="emotion">Jealousy</phrase> inside, make 'em wish I died</line>
            <line>Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for</line>
            <line>Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door</line>
            <line><phrase type="lifeEvent">And all my memories of seein' brothers
                bleed</phrase></line>
            <line>And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees</line>
            <line>Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix</line>
            <line>‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks</line>

            <line>I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it</line>
            <line>Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked</line>
            <line>Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV</line>

            <line>I wake up stranglin', dangled in my bed sheets</line>
            <line>I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce</line>
            <line>How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss</line>
            <line>Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here</line>
            <line>‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?</line>
            <line>Try to remember but it hurts</line>
            <line>I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt</line>
            <line>I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward</line>
            <line>There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours</line>
            <line>"Black Power!" is what we scream</line>
            <line>As we dream in a paranoid state</line>
            <line>And our fate is a lifetime of hate</line>
            <line>Dear Mama, can you save me? And <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase>
                peace</line>
            <line>‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat</line>
            <line>No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped</line>
            <line>And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped</line>
            <line>Mr. Police, please try to see</line>
            <line>That there's a million <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> stressin'
