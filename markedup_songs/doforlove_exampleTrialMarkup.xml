    <title>Do For Love</title>

<intro><singer>[2pac:]</singer>
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, right?
Word up, hahahahaha
</intro>
<verse><singer>[2pac:]</singer>
I shoulda seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can't help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> could see
I never planned to be <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r man it just wasn't me
But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> from harm, <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>n't be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> got me stressin'
Soon as I open up the <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>or with <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r jealous questions
Like where can I be <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>'re killin' me with <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love
</verse>
<chorus><singer p="eric">[Eric Williams:]</singer>
What <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> won't <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>, <keyword k="2">/0</keyword> for love
You tried everything, but <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>n't give up
What <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> won't <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>, <keyword k="2">/0</keyword> for love
You tried everything, but <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>n't give up</chorus>

<verse><singer p="2pac">[2pac:]</singer>
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
<lifeEvent>You try to trap me say <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> pregnant and guess who the daddy</lifeEvent>
Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>? So now I'm back
To makin promises to <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>, tryin to keep it true
What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> goin
I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close
To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control
My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
<lifeEvent>You gettin' calls at the house, guess <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> cheatin'</lifeEvent>
That's all I need to hear cause I'm leavin', I'm out the <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>'
Never no more will <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> see me, this is the end
Cause now I know <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>'ve been cheatin, I'm a sucka for love
</verse>
<chorus><singer>[Eric Williams:]</singer>
What <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> won't <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>, <keyword k="2">/0</keyword> for love
You tried everything, but <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>n't give up
What <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> won't <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>, <keyword k="2">/0</keyword> for love
You tried everything, but <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> <keyword k="2">/0</keyword>n't give up</chorus>

<verse><singer>[2pac:]</singer>
Now he left <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> with scars, tears on <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r pillow and <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> still stay
As <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away
It wasn't always a hit and run relationship
It use to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> good
<lifeEvent>I moved <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood</lifeEvent>
Me and <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I shoulda seen <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> was trouble but I was lost, trapped in <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r eyes
Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, <keyword k="1">/0</keyword> told me
Don't worry bout it we can <keyword k="2">/0</keyword> it now I'm under pressure
Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone
I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
I wanna take <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r misery, replace it with happiness
But I need <keyword k="1">/0</keyword>r faith in me, I'm a sucka for love
</verse>
