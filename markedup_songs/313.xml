<line>Now, what you know about a sweet MC from the 313?</line>
<line>None of these skills you 'bout to see come free</line>
<line>So you wanna be a sweet MC, you gotta become me</line>
<line>If you ever wanna be one, see</line></chorus>

<verse><line>[Verse 1: <featuredArtist>Eye-Kyu</featuredArtist>]</line>
<line>Yo, some people say I'm whack, now if that's right I'm</line>
<line>The freshest whack MC that you ever heard in your lifetime</line>
<line>My slick acapella sounds clever with the beats, boy</line>
<line>I'm the deepest thing since potholes to ever hit the streets</line>
<line>Forget a gold digger's succubus</line>
<line>My soul's thick with ruggedness</line>
<line>With the mic I'm like a dyke: can't no <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with this</line>
<line>I got more different strokes than Philip Drummound</line>
<line>On open mic I bone your women</line>
<line>Just to keep my lyrics comin'</line>
<line>We elevated to new heights, premeditated</line>
<line>Let it be that I stated, they hate it</line>
<phrase type="lifeEvent"><line>Now that they see that I made it</line></phrase>
<line>The escalated can be put to the test of greatness</line>
<line>Snatch the heart from MC's and I ate it</line>
<line>So I take it, that's the reason I'm hated</line>
<line>To represent's my temperament</line>
<line>If rap was a dick, all you so called hard MC's would not be impotent, but pimpin' it</line>
<line>And actin' like you could rock a show</line>
<line>Harder than LL's rock the bells, but yous a <phrase type="dt">hoe</phrase></line>
<line>Everything that you collaborate I lacerate</line>
<line>My rhymes they keep comin'</line>
<line>Like nymphomaniacs that masturbate</line>
<line>At a faster rate, yeah, I got somethin' for your <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> to hate</line>
<line>I blast your hate, and have you all runnin' master gates</line>
<line>And as for face clutchin' and touchin' the flows</line>
<line>I got them open like marijuana smoke up in your nose</line>
<line>Buckin' these <phrase type="dt">hoes</phrase>, I got that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> down to a science</line>
<line>Leavin' them hot and bothered, turned on, like an appliance</line>
<line>Defiance? No, we won't have that</line>
<line>You want your <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> to blow up?</line>
<line>Well, I'ma stuff some dynamite in your <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> crack</line>
<line>And blast that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> to kingdom come</line>
<line>Then bring them some of this real hip-hop</line>
<line>I drop beats and you ain't singin' or gonna do a thing but run</line>
<line>And you all knew from Meeko</line>
<line>That you couldn't hold your own</line>
<line>With the strength of Lou Ferrigno</line>
<line>So, stop that <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase> and flow, yo</line>
<line>You need to come with the real skills and act like you know</line></verse>

<verse><line>[Verse 2: <artist>Eminem</artist>]</line>
<line>So what you know about a sweet MC in the 313?</line>
<line>You don't know shit, so when you see one, flee</line>
<line>You can be Run-D, you'll never be the MC</line>
<line>I stopped the alphabet at S and got it down to a T</line>
<line>I'm sure you're bound to agree, a sweet MC crash the spot</line>
<line>I'll make the roof hot like I was Rock Master Scott</line>
<line>Your <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> forgot, so just in case you don't remember me</line>
<line>I'll run your brain round the block to jog your <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> memory</line>
<line>It's either them or me, man, kill or be killed</line>
<line>You will'll be sealed, your casket closed, you still'll be billed</line>
<line>My facilities filled with fans, packed to capacity</line>
<line>I'll send a rapper back with the crack of his <phrase type="profanity">ass shitty</phrase></line>
<line>If he's actin' soft and he cowers, he better come cleaner</line>
<line>Than Jeru jackin' off when he showers</line>
<line>You flowers got no clout with a thing</line>
<line>You could date a stick of dynamite</line>
<line>And wouldn't go out with a bang</line>
<line>I shout with a slang, simple as ABC's</line>
<line>Skip over the D's and rock the microphone with ease</line>
<line>Dethrone MC's, and I'ma max alone</line>
<line>Relax your dome, like a solo from a saxophone</line>
<line>So facts are known, biters get treated with shots</line>
<line>I rock a beat harder than you could beat it with rocks</line>
<line>I'm greeted with flocks of fellow followers' singers</line>
<line>You couldn't make the fans throw up their hands</line>
<line>If they swallowed their fingers</line>
<line>But you can bring yours, let's see what you got</line>
<line>But don't front, and never try to be what you're not</line>
<line>'Cause you can be quick</line>
<line>Jump the candlestick, burn your back</line>
<line>And <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> Jill on a hill, but you still ain't jack</line></verse>
