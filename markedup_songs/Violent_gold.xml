    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>They claim that I'm violent</line>
            <line>Just cause I refuse to be silent</line>
            <line>These hypocrites are havin' fits</line>
            <line>’Cause I'm not buyin' it, defyin' it</line>
            <line><phrase type="emotion">Envious</phrase> because I will rebel against</line>
            <line>Any oppressor - and this is known as self defense</line>
            <line>I show no mercy, they claim that I'm the lunatic</line>
            <line>But when the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> gets thick, I'm the one you go
                and get</line>
            <line>Don't look confused, the truth is so plain to see</line>
            <line>’Cause I'm the <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> that you sell-outs are
                    <phrase type="emotion">ashamed</phrase> to be</line>
            <line>In every jeep and every car, brothers stomp this</line>
            <line>I'm Never Ignorant, Getting Goals Accomplished</line>
            <line>The Underground Railroad on an uprise</line>
            <line>This time the truth's gettin' told, heard enough lies</line>
            <line>I told 'em fight back, attack on society</line>
            <line>If this is violence, then violent's what I gotta be</line>
            <line>If you investigate you'll find out where it's comin' from</line>
            <line>Look through our history, America's the violent one</line>
            <line>Unlock my brain, break the chains of your misery</line>
            <line>This time the payback for evil <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> you did to
                me</line>
            <line>They call me militant, racist, cause I will resist</line>
            <line>You wanna censor somethin', <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> censor
                this!</line>
            <line>My words are weapons and I'm steppin' to the silent</line>
            <line>Wakin' up the masses, but you, claim that I'm violent</line>

        <verse>
            <line>The cops can't stand me, but they can't touch me</line>
            <line>Call me a dope man, cause I rock dope beats</line>
            <line>Jacked by the police, didn't have my ID</line>
            <line>I said, "Excuse me, why you tryin' to rob me?"</line>
            <line>He had the nerve to, say that I had a curfew</line>
            <line>("Do you know what time it is?</line>
            <line>Get out the <phrase type="profanity">fucking</phrase> car, or I'll hurt
                you!")</line>
            <line>Get out the car - or I'lI hurt you</line>
            <line>So here I go, I better make my mind up</line>
            <line>Pick my nine up or hit the line-up</line>
            <line>I chose B, stepped into the streets</line>
            <line>The first cop grabbed me, the other ripped my seat</line>
            <line>They grabbed my homie and they threw him to the concrete</line>
            <line>(Ay man... Aiyyo... Ay man, just c'mon?)</line>
            <line>("What you doin man?")</line>
            <line>They tried to frame me</line>
            <line>They tried to say I had some dope in the back seat</line>
            <line>But I'm a rap fiend, not a crack fiend</line>
            <line>My homie panicked ("I'm out") he tried to run</line>
            <line>(Freeze <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>!) I heard a bullet fire from the
                cop's gun</line>
            <line>My homie dropped, so I hit the cop</line>
            <line>I kept swingin', yo, I couldn't stop</line>
            <line>Before I knew it, I was beatin' the cop senseless</line>
            <line>The other cop dropped his gun, he was defenseless</line>
            <line>(Argh, <phrase>fuck</phrase> you! Ungh!)</line>
            <line>Now I'm against this cop who was racist</line>
            <line>Givin' him a taste, of trading places</line>
            <line>And all this, cause the peckerwood was tryin' this</line>
            <line>Frame up, but I came up</line>
            <line>Now they claimin' that I'm violent</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>"They claimin' that I'm violent"</line>

        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>As I was beatin' on a cop, I heard a gun click (uh-ohh)</line>
            <line>Then the gun shot, but I wasn't hit</line>
            <line>I turned around it was my homie with the gun in hand</line>
            <line>He shot the cop (<phrase type="profanity">Damn</phrase>!) now he's a dead
                man</line>
            <line>I said, come on, it's time for us to get away</line>
            <line>(Let's go, we gotta get the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> outta
                here.)</line>
            <line>They called for backup, and they'll be on their way</line>
            <line>Jumped in the car and tried to get away quick</line>
            <line>The car wouldn't start (<phrase type="profanity">Damn</phrase>!) we in deep
                shit</line>
            <line>So we jumped out (C'mon, let's take the cop's car)</line>
            <line>We drove a little ways thinkin' that we got far</line>
            <line>But I looked up and all I saw was blue lights</line>
            <line>(that's a lotta of one time)</line>
            <line>If I die tonight, I'm dying in a gunfight</line>
            <line>I grabbed the AK, my homie took the 12 gauge</line>
            <line>(yeah, it's on now)</line>
            <line>Load 'em up quick, it's time for us to spray</line>
            <line>We'll shoot 'em up with they own <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase>
                weapons</line>
            <line>And when we through sprayin' then we steppin'</line>
            <line>This is a lesson, to the rednecks and crooked cops</line>
            <line>You <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with real <phrase type="profanity"
                    >niggas</phrase>, get ya <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase>
                <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> dropped</line>
            <line>So here we go, the police against us</line>
            <line>Dark as dusk, waitin' for the guns to bust</line>
            <line>(What's next man?) What's next, I don't know and I don't care</line>
            <line>One thing fo' sho', tommorrow I won't be here</line>
            <line>But if I go, I'm takin' all these punks with me</line>
            <line>(Pass me a clip) Pass me a clip, G, now come and get me</line>
            <line>You wanna sweat me, never get me to be silent</line>
            <line>Givin' them a reason, to claim that I'm violent</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>"They claimin' that I'm violent"</line>
            <line>"<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> the <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase>
