    <lyrics>
        <chorus>I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah You don't wanna <phrase type="profanity"
                >fuck</phrase> with me Got the police bustin' at me But they can't do nothin' to a G
            Let's get ready to rumble!</chorus>
        <intro> Now, you know how we do it, like a G What really go on in the mind of a <phrase
                type="profanity">nigga</phrase> That get down for theirs Constantly, money over
                <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase> Not <phrase type="profanity"
                >bitches</phrase> over money Stay on your grind, <phrase type="profanity"
                >nigga</phrase> My ambitions as a ridah My ambitions as a ridah</intro>


        <verse>So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars This life as a rap star is
            nothin' without guard Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public My attitude
            was "<phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> it," because <phrase>motherfuckers</phrase>
            love it To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease Though life is complicated,
            only what you make it to be Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah To catch her while she hot
            and horny, go up inside her Then I spit some game in her ear, "Go to the telly, <phrase
                type="dt">hoe</phrase>!" Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, <phrase
                type="profanity">bitch</phrase>, I'm barely broke I'm smokin' <phrase
                type="profanity">bomb-ass</phrase> weed, feelin' crucial From player to player the
            game's tight, the feeling's mutual From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' <phrase
                type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> to pay up I got no time for these <phrase
                type="profanity">bitches</phrase>, ‘cause these <phrase type="dt">hoes</phrase> try
            to play us I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill, so I'm wishin' Competition got me
            ripped on that <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase> they stressin' I'ma rhyme
            though, clown hoes like it's mandatory No guts, no glory, my <phrase type="profanity"
                >nigga</phrase>, <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> got the game distorted Now
            it's on and it's on because I said so <phrase type="lifeEvent">Can't trust a <phrase
                    type="profanity">bitch</phrase> in the business, so I got with Death
                Row</phrase> Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious Started plottin' and
            plannin' on schemes to come and trick us But thug niggas be on point and game tight Me,
            Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers
            see me These niggas is <phrase type="emotion">jealous</phrase> ‘Cause deep in they heart
            they wanna be me Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen I catch
            you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah</verse>

        <chorus>I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah You don't wanna <phrase type="profanity"
                >fuck</phrase> with me Got the police bustin' at me But they can't do nothin' to a G
            Let's get ready to rumble</chorus>

        <verse>It was my only wish to rise Above these <phrase type="emotion">jealous</phrase>
            coward <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> I despise When it's time to ride
            I was the first off this side, give me the 9 I'm ready to die right here tonight and
                <phrase type="profanity">motherfuck</phrase> they life That's what they screamin' as
            they drill me, but I'm hard to kill (That's all you <phrase type="profanity"
                >niggas</phrase> got?!) So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel Spittin'
            at adversaries, <phrase type="emotion">envious</phrase> and after me I'd rather die
            before they capture me, watch me bleed Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin'
            thoughts I'm innocent, so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot!) <phrase
                type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> doin' jail time, better day, sacrificin' Won't get a
            chance to do me like they did my <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> Tyson Thuggin'
            for life, and if you right, then <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> die for it Let
            them other brothers try, at least you tried for it When it's time to die, to be a man
            and pick the way you leave <phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> peace and the police,
            my ambitions as a ridah</verse>

        <chorus>I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah You don't wanna <phrase type="profanity"
                >fuck</phrase> with me Got the police bustin' at me But they can't do nothin' to a G
            Let's get ready to rumble</chorus>

        <verse>My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me <phrase
                type="lifeEvent">Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they comin' for
                me</phrase> I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years Now I'm back, my
            adversaries been reduced to tears Question my methods to switch up speeds Sure as some
                <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase> bleed <phrase type="profanity"
                >Niggas'll</phrase> feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed Blast me, but they
            didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers (Buck buck buck buck buck!) So now I'm back to
            be a <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> menace, they cowards That's why
            they tried to set me up Had <phrase type="profanity">bitch-ass niggas</phrase> on my
            team, so indeed they wet me up But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated At the time I
            contemplate the way that God made it Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical
            mercenary For money I'll have these <profanity type="profanity"
                >motherfuckers</profanity> buried I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin'
            me to kill it Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah
            when I put the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> inside The cry from all your
            people when they find her Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic Revenge on them
                <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that played me And all the cowards that was
            down with it Now it's your <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> right beside ya,
            hopin' you listenin' Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah</verse>

        <chorus>I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah You don't wanna <phrase type="profanity"
                >fuck</phrase> with me Got the police bustin' at me But they can't do nothin' to a G
