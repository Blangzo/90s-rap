    <lyrics>
        <verse>
            <line>You know they got me trapped in this prison of seclusion</line>
            <line><phrase type="emotion">Happiness</phrase>, living on the streets is a
                delusion</line>
            <line>Even a smooth criminal one day must get caught</line>
            <line>Shot up or shot down with the bullet that he bought</line>
            <line>Nine millimeter kickin' thinkin' about what the streets do to me</line>
            <line>Cause they never talk peace in the black community</line>
            <line>All we know is violence, do the job in silence</line>
            <line>Walk the city streets like a rat pack of tyrants</line>
            <line>Too many brothers daily heading for the big pen</line>
            <line><phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> comin' out worse-off than when they went
                in</line>
            <line>Over the years I done a lot of growin' up</line>
            <line>Gettin drunk, throwin' up</line>
            <line>Cuffed up</line>
            <line>Then I said I had enough</line>
            <line>There must be another route, way out</line>
            <line>To money and fame, I changed my name</line>
            <line>And played a different game</line>
            <line>Tired of being trapped in this vicious cycle</line>
            <line>If one more cop harrasses me I just might go psycho</line>
            <line>And when I get 'em, I'll hit 'em with the bum rush</line>
            <line>Only a lunatic would like to see his skull crushed</line>
            <line>Yo, if you're smart you'll really let me go, G</line>
            <line>But keep me cooped up in this ghetto and catch the Uzi</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
            <line>Can barely walk the city streets</line>
            <line>Without a cop harrassing me, searching me</line>
            <line>Then asking my identity</line>
            <line>Hands up, throw me up against the wall</line>
            <line>Didn't do a thing at all</line>
            <line>I'm telling you one day these suckers gotta fall</line>
            <line>Cuffed up throw me on the concrete</line>
            <line>Coppers try to kill me</line>
            <line>But they didn't know this was the wrong street</line>
            <line>Bang bang, count another casualty</line>
            <line>But it's a cop who's shot for his brutality</line>
            <line>Who do you blame? It's a shame because the man's slain</line>
            <line>He got caught in the chains of his own game</line>
            <line>How can I feel guilty after all the things they did to me?</line>
            <line>Sweated me, hunted me</line>
            <line>Trapped in my own community</line>
            <line>One day I'm gonna bust</line>
            <line>Blow up on this society</line>
            <line>Why did ya lie to me?</line>
            <line>I couldn't find a trace of equality</line>
            <line>Work me like a slave while they laid back</line>
            <line>Homie don't play that</line>
            <line>It's time I let 'em suffer the payback</line>
            <line>I'm tryin to avoid physical contact</line>
            <line>I can't hold back, it's time to attack jack</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
        </chorus>

        <verse>
            <line>Now I'm trapped and want to find my getaway</line>
            <line>All I need is a 'G' and somewhere safe to stay</line>
            <line>Can't use the phone</line>
            <line>Cause I'm sure someone is tapping in</line>
            <line>Did it before</line>
            <line>Ain't scared to use my gat again</line>
            <line>I look back in hindsight the fight was irrelevant</line>
            <line>But now he's the devils friend</line>
            <line>Too late to be tellin' him</line>
            <line>He shot first and I'll be <phrase type="profanity">damned</phrase> if I run
                away</line>
            <line>Homie is done away I should've put my gun away</line>
            <line>I wasn't thinkin' all I heard was the ridicule</line>
            <line>Girlies was laughin', Tup sayin "<phrase type="profanity">Damn</phrase> homies is
                dissin you"</line>
            <line>I fired my weapon</line>
            <line>Started steppin' in the hurricane</line>
            <line>I got shot so I dropped</line>
            <line>Feelin' a burst of pain</line>
            <line>Got to my feet</line>
            <line>Couldn't see nothin' but bloody blood</line>
            <line>Now I'm a fugitive to be hunted like a murderer</line>
            <line>Ran through an alley</line>
            <line>Still lookin' for my getaway</line>
            <line>Coppers said, "Freeze, or you'll be dead today."</line>
            <line>Trapped in a corner</line>
            <line>Dark and I couldn't see the light</line>
            <line>Thoughts in my mind was the nine and a better life</line>
            <line>What do I do? Live my life in a prison cell?</line>
            <line>I'd rather die than be trapped in a living hell</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>They got me trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Uh uh, they can't keep the black man down</line>
            <line>Trapped</line>
            <line>Naw, they can't keep the black man down</line>
