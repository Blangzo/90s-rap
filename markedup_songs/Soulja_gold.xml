<intro>SOULJA'S STORY LYRICS
[Intro: <artist>2Pac</artist> and <featuredArtist>2Pac as "Soulja"</featuredArtist>]
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
They cuttin' off welfare...
They think crime is rising now
You got whites killing blacks
Cops killing blacks, and blacks killing blacks
Shit just gon' get worse
They just gon' become souljas
Straight souljas
</intro>
<chorus>[Hook]
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me</chorus>

<verse>[Verse 1: <featuredArtist>2Pac as "Soulja"</featuredArtist>]
Crack done took a part of my family tree
My momma's on the shit, my daddy split and moms is steady blaming me
Is it my fault, just cause I'm a young black male?
Cops sweat me as if my destiny is makin' crack sales
Only fifteen and got problems
Cops on my tail, so I bail 'til I dodge 'em
They finally pull me over and I laugh
"Remember Rodney King?" and I blast on his punk ass
Now I got a murder case...
You speak of heaven punk? I never heard of the place
Wanted to come up fast, got a Uz' and a black mask
Ducking <profanity>fuckin'</profanity> Task, now who's the <profanity>jackass</profanity>?
Keep my <profanity>shit</profanity> cocked, cause the cops got a Glock too
What the <profanity>fuck</profanity> would you do? Drop them or let 'em drop you?
I chose droppin' the cop
I got me a Glock, and a Glock for the <profanity>niggas</profanity> on my block
Momma tried to stab me, I moved out
Sold a pound a weed, made G's, bought a new house
I'm only seventeen, I'm the new king
Got me a crew, bought 'em jewels, and a Uz'-thick
But all good things don't last
Task came fast, and busted my black <profanity>ass</profanity>
Coolin' in the pen, where the good's kept
Now my little brother wants to follow in my footsteps
A soulja
</verse>
[Hook]
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me

<verse>[Verse 2: <artist>2Pac</artist> as the younger brother]
Buck, buck -<profanity>niggas</profanity> get <profanity>fucked</profanity>, don't step to this
Quiet as kept I'm blessed on a quest with a death wish
Tell 'em to come and test, and arrest, <profanity>nigga</profanity> it's hectic
Here's the anorexic, I'm makin' it to an exit
Walking through the streets on the black tip
Packed with several gats, cause I'm on some pay 'em back shit
<profanity>Niggas</profanity> don't wanna try me, brother you'll get shot down
Now I'm king of the block, since my bigger brother's locked down
I'm hot now, so many punk police have got shot down
Other coppers see me on the block, and they jock now
That's what I call a kingpin
Send my brother what he needs and some weed up to Sing-Sing
Tellin' him just be ready set
Pack ya <profanity>shit</profanity> up quick; and when I hit, be prepared to jet
<profanity>Niggas</profanity> from the block on the boat now
Every single one got a gun, that'll smoke - pow!
These punks about to get hit by the best
I'm wearin' double vest... so aim at my <profanity>fuckin'</profanity> chest
I'll be makin' straight dome calls
Touch the button on the wall, you'll be pickin' up your own balls
I can still hear my mother shout
"Hit the pen <profanity>nigga</profanity> -- break your bigger brother out"
I got a message for the warden
I'm comin' for ya <profanity>ass</profanity>, as fast as Flash Gordon
We get surrounded in the mess hall, yes y'all
A crazy <profanity>motherfucker</profanity> making death calls
Just bring me my brother and we leavin'
For every minute you stall, one of y'all bleedin'
They brought my brother in a jiffy
I took a cop, just in case things got tricky
And just as we was walkin' out (BANG!)
I caught a bullet in the head, the screams never left my mouth
My brother caught a bullet too
I think he gon' pull through, he deserve to
The fast life ain't everything they told ya
Never get much older, following the tracks of a soulja</verse>

<outro>[Outro]
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
All you wanted to be, a soulja, a soulja
All you wanted to be, a soulja, like me
Straight soulja, 1993, and forward</outro></song>
