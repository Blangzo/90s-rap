<verse><featuredSinger>[2Pac]</featuredSinger>
A <phrase type="profanity">smoking-ass</phrase> nigga robbed me blind
I got a TEC-9 now his <phrase type="profanity">smokin' ass</phrase> is mine
I guess I felt sorry for the <phrase type="dt">bastard</phrase>, he was broke
I didn't know he smoked so I didn't watch him close
He caught me on the sneak tip, now the punk's in deep <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>
Catch him on the streets, I'mma bring him to his feet, quick
Pass the clip, I think I see him comin' now
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> the <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase>, posse deep and let's run him down
Gots to be the first one to hit ya when we meet
Comin' quickly up the streets, is the punk <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> police
The first one jumped out and said "Freeze!"
I popped him in his knees and shot him, punk, please
â€™Cause cops should mind they business, when we rush
Now you're pleadin' like a <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase>, cause you don't know how to, hush
Now back to the smoker that robbed me
I tell you like Latifah, <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> give me body
One to the chest, another to his <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> dome
Now the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> can rest, yo tell him to leave me the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> alone
Two very bloody bodies on the streets
A nosey <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> cop and a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> that robbed from me
Run from your backup punk, how you figure?
My finger's on the trigger for you crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase></verse>

<chorus>Crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see--)
(Cri-cri-criminal)
</chorus>
<verse><featuredSinger>[Stretch]</featuredSinger>
Now listen to the mack of the crooked <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> trade
With the fine criminal mind, cold rips like a blade
It's already quick steppin to the <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> with the props
And any <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> with the flim-flam drops to the knot
Ten o'clock, is a <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> gank move
Stretch is Uptown, clockin' weight the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> is real smooth
A <phrase type="profanity">nigga's</phrase> tryin to play me like he know me but he don't
Sittin' on ten kis, I'mma get him, think I won't?
My <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> 2Pac, got the <phrase type="profanity">fuckin</phrase> Glock cocked, and he's ready
When the kid, didn't even bring the weight bag, instead he
Welcomed us, into his apartment
Oh, this even better, two to the head, he's dead a clean get a-WAY!
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> got PAID!
And yet another sleepin' ass <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> got slayed, word up
By a crooked <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> named Stretch
And the T-U-P-A-C, the police can't catch

[Hook]
The crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
(Criminal behaviour)
Yeah, you don't stop!
Crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
(Criminal-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)

[Verse 3: 2Pac]
Now I could be a crooked <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> too
When I'm rollin' with my crew, watch what crooked <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, do!
I got a nine millimeter Glock pistol
I'm ready to get witcha at the drop, of a whistle
So make your move, and act like you wanna flip
I fire thirteen shots, and pop another clip
I bring luck, my Glock's like a <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> mop
The more I shot, the more <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> dropped
And even cops got shot when they rolled up
Best to bring a knot, or get popped, I'm a soldier
I ain't the type to fetch ya, ask Stretch, he's my witness
Smoke til I'm blitzed, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> a <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> piss test
I'm trigger happy, try to 'tack me and I'll drop you quick
Long as I got a clip I got some shit to hit 'em with
The <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> killer I get iller when the <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> gets thick
My brain flips, I start thinkin' like a lunatic
I rip <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>, came equipped with a bigger crew
I thought these <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> knew, I'm a crooked <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> too

[Outro]
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal behaviour)
Crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> come in all shapes and sizes
They wear disguises, backstabbing's what they specialize in
They'll try to get 'cha, they'll sweat 'cha to get in the picture
And then they hit 'cha, son of a <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase>! Now he's richer
(Criminal behaviour-- crimi-criminal behaviour)
Crooked <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(Criminal behaviour-- criminal-- criminal
Crimi-crim-criminal behaviour (haviour)-- criminal behaviour
Criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(Criminal behaviour- criminal be- criminal crim--
Crim-criminal behaviour
Criminal be- crim-crim-crim-crim-crim--
Criminal behaviour-- criminal behaviour)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Got him)
(Suddenly I see, some <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that I don't like)
(*machine gun fires)
(Got him)
