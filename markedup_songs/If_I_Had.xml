        <intro>
            <line>"Life," by Marshall Mathers</line>
            <line>What is life? Life is like a big obstacle</line>
            <line>Put in front of your optical to slow you down</line>
            <line>And every time you think you've gotten past it</line>
            <line>It's gonna come back around</line>
            <line>And tackle you to the <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase> ground</line>
            <line>What are friends?</line>
            <line>Friends are people that you think are your friends</line>
            <line>But they're really your enemies, with secret identities</line>
            <line>And disguises to hide their true colors</line>
            <line>So just when you think you're close enough to be brothers</line>
            <line>They wanna come back</line>
            <line>And cut your throat when you ain't lookin'</line>
            <line>What is money?</line>
            <line>Money is what makes a man act funny</line>
            <line>Money is the root of all evil</line>
            <line>Money'll make them same friends come back around</line>
            <line>Swearin' that they was always down</line>
            <line>What is life? I'm tired of life</line>
        </intro>

        <verse>
            <line>I'm tired of backstabbin'-ass snakes with friendly grins</line>
            <line>I'm tired of committin' so many sins</line>
            <line>Tired of always givin' in when this bottle of Henny wins</line>
            <line>Tired of never havin' any ends</line>
            <line>Tired of havin' skinny friends, hooked on crack and Mini Thins</line>
            <line>I'm tired of this DJ playin' your shit when he spins</line>
            <line>Tired of not havin' a deal</line>
            <line>Tired of havin' to deal with the bullshit without grabbin' a steel</line>
            <line>Tired of drownin' in my sorrow</line>
            <line>Tired of havin' to borrow a dollar for gas to start my Monte Carlo</line>
            <line>I'm tired of <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> sprayin' <phrase
                    type="profanity">shit</phrase> and dartin' off</line>
            <line>I'm tired of jobs startin' off</line>
            <line>At $5.50 an hour, then this boss wonders why I'm smartin' off</line>
            <line>I'm tired of bein' fired every time I fart and cough</line>
            <line>Tired of havin' to work as a gas station clerk</line>
            <line>For this jerk, breathin' down my neck, drivin' me berserk</line>
            <line>I'm tired of usin' plastic silverware</line>
            <line>Tired of workin' at Builder's Square</line>
            <line>Tired of not bein' a millionaire</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>But if I had a million dollars</line>
            <line>I'd buy a <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase> brewery and turn the planet into
                alcoholics</line>
            <line>If I had a magic wand</line>
            <line>I'd make the world suck my dick without a condom on</line>
            <line>While I'm on the john</line>
            <line>If I had a million bucks, it wouldn't be enough</line>
            <line>Because I'd still be out robbin' armored trucks</line>
            <line>If I had one wish, I would ask</line>
            <line>For a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss</line></chorus>

        <verse><line>I'm tired of bein' white trash, broke and always poor</line>

            <line>Tired of not workin' at GM, tired of wantin' to be him</line>
            <line>Tired of not sleepin' without a Tylenol PM</line>
            <line>Tired of not performin' in a packed coliseum</line>
            <line>Tired of not bein' on tour</line>

                    type="dt">whore</phrase></line>
            <line>After work, in the back of a Contour</line>
            <line>I'm tired of fakin' knots with a stack of ones</line>
            <line>Havin' a lack of funds and resortin' back to guns</line>
            <line>Tired of bein' stared at</line>
            <line>Tired of wearin' the same <phrase type="profanity">damn</phrase> Nike Air
                hat</line>
            <line>Tired of steppin' in clubs, wearin' the same pair of Lugz</line>
            <line>Tired of people sayin' they're tired of hearin' me rap about drugs</line>
            <line>Tired of other rappers who ain't bringin' half the skill as me</line>
            <line>Sayin' they wasn't feelin' me on "Nobody's As Ill As Me"</line>
            <line>And I'm tired of radio stations tellin' fibs</line>
            <line>Tired of JLB sayin', "where hip-hop lives"</line>
        </verse>

        <chorus>
            <line>But if I had a million dollars</line>

        <outro>
            <line>You know what I'm sayin'?</line>
            <line>I'm tired of all of this <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase>, tellin' me to
                be positive</line>
            <line>How am I 'posed to be positive when I don't see <phrase type="profanity"
                    >shit</phrase> positive?</line>
            <line>You know what I'm sayin'?</line>
            <line>I rap about <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase> around me, shit I see</line>
            <line>You know what I'm sayin'?</line>
            <line>And right now, I'm tired of everything</line>
            <line>Tired of all this player-hatin' that's goin' on in my own city</line>
            <line>Can't get no airplay, you know what I'm sayin'?</line>
            <line>But hey, it's cool though, you know what I'm sayin'?</line>
            <line>I'm just fed up, that's my word</line>
