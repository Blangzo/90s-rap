    Up out of there
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin like that?
    Ah <profanity>shit</profanity>, you done <profanity>fucked</profanity> up now
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
    You done put two of America's most wanted in the same <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> place at the same motherfuckin' time
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
    Y'all <profanity>niggas</profanity> about to feel this
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
    Break out the Champagne glasses and the <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> condoms, have one on us, a'ight?
    (Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)</chorus>
    
    <intro><featuredSinger>[Snoop Dogg:]</featuredSinger>
    A toast to the gangsters</intro>
    
    <verse><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
    Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
    Bomb the hoochies with precision
    My intention's to get richer
    With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my <profanity>fuckin'</profanity> homie
    You's a <profanity>cold-ass nigga</profanity> on them hogs
    </verse>
    <verse><featuredSinger>[Snoop Dogg:]</featuredSinger>
    Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
    'Cause they got me on the run
    Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
    "Free 2Pac" is all that's on a <profanity>nigga's</profanity> mind
    But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
    So I'ma get smart and get defensive and <profanity>shit</profanity>
    And put together a Million March for some gangsta <profanity>shit</profanity>
    </verse>
    <verse><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
    So now they got us laced
    Two multi-millionaire <profanity>motherfuckers</profanity> catchin' cases
    <profanity>Bitches</profanity> get ready for the throw down
    The <profanity>shit's</profanity> about to go down
    Me and Snoop about to clown
    I'm losin' my religion
    I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
    You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
    <profanity>Niggas</profanity> be actin' like they savage
    They out to get the cabbage
    I've got nothin' but <emotion>love</emotion> for my <profanity>niggas</profanity> livin' lavish
    </verse>
    <verse><featuredSinger>[Snoop Dogg:]</featuredSinger>
    I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerina
    I've got a house out in the hills right next to Chino
    And I think I've got a black Bimmer
    But my dream's to own a fly casino
    Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
    And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
    It feels good to you, baby-bubba
    You see, this is for the G's and the keys, <profanity>motherfucker</profanity></verse>
    
    <verse>[2Pac:]
    Now follow as we ride
    <profanity>Motherfuck</profanity> the rest, two of the best from the West side
    And I can make you famous
    <profanity>Niggas</profanity> been dyin' for years, so how could they blame us?
    I live in <emotion>fear</emotion> of a felony
    I never stop bailin' these <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> G's
    If you got it, better flaunt it
    Another warrant for <songTitle>two of America's most wanted</songTitle></verse>
    
    <chorus>[Daz Dillinger (2Pac):]
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party</chorus>
    
    <verse><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
    Now give me fifty feet
    Defeat is not my destiny, release me to the streets
    And keep whatever's left of me
    <emotion>Jealousy</emotion> is misery, sufferin' is <emotion>grief</emotion>
    Better be prepared when you cowards <profanity>fuck</profanity> with me
    I bust and flee, these <profanity>niggas</profanity> must be crazy, what?
    There ain't no mercy, <profanity>motherfuckers</profanity> who can't fade the thugs
    You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
    Bow down in the presence of a boss player</verse>
    
    <verse><featuredSinger>[Snoop Dogg:]</featuredSinger>
    It's like Cuz/Blood gang-bangin'
    Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
    You gotta have papers in this world
    You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
    You doin' your job every day
    And then you work so hard 'til your hair turns gray
    Let me tell you about life and about the way it is
    You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kids</verse>
    
    <verse><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
    They tell me not to roll with my glock
    So now I got a throw-away
    Floatin' in the black Benz, tryin' to do a show a day
    They wonder how I live with five shots
    <profanity>Niggas</profanity> is hard to kill on my block
    Schemes for currency and dough-related
    Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
    No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
    My <profanity>nigga</profanity> Dogg with me, eternally the most wanted</verse>
    
    <chorus>[Daz Dillinger (2Pac):]
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    It ain't nothin' but a <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    It ain't nothin' but a <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    It ain't nothin' but a <profanity>motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    (Nothin' but a gangsta party
    It ain't nothin' but a<profanity> motherfuckin'</profanity> gangsta party)
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party</chorus>
    
    <outro><singer>[2Pac:]</singer>
    <profanity>Biatch!</profanity> Where you at? Where you at?
    Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
    Yeah, Death Row</outro></lyrics></song>
