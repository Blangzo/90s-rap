            <line>I know this crack fiend, Maxine, who needs a vaccine</line>
            <line>She tests positive, but tells you that her act's clean</line>
            <line>Plus she got a sugar daddy</line>
            <line>Gassin' every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly</line>
            <line>If you mistook her, sadly, on her reputation</line>
            <line>You're in jeopardation, if you ain't got no preparation</line>
            <line>When you stepped away, son, she got her face done</line>
            <line>Lookin' provocative, she'll let you knock it if</line>
            <line>You press the issue, and get undressed to kiss you</line>
            <line>If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice</line>
            <line>But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency</line>
            <line>To go to the emergency ‘cause it burns to pee</line>
            <line>Don't bring your germs to me, ‘cause I ain't tryna hear it</line>
            <line>While you're fightin' your <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> disease,
                tryna clear it</line>

            <line>Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose in life?</line>
            <line>That is to get with every brother</line>

            <line>I met this girl last week</line>
            <line>She was a <phrase type="profanity">freak</phrase>, and she liked me</line>
            <line>So I stepped on it and then asked my homies</line>
            <line>And chilled on the side and then watched they <phrase type="profanity"
                    >niggas</phrase></line>
            <line>Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number</line>
            <line>I stepped to her, first I cleared my throat</line>
            <line>And said: "Hey, <phrase type="dt">bitch</phrase>, haven't I seen you
                before?"</line>
            <line>Looked at my <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, turned around and got
                slapped</line>
            <line>Throughout my hands, and said: "Oh, it's like that?"</line>
            <line>She said she just broke up with her <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> and
                    <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase></line>
            <line>She started cryin', and asked me to forgive her and <phrase type="profanity"
                    >shit</phrase></line>
            <line>She said her name was Maxine</line>
            <line>So I told her I wanted her number</line>
            <line>She asked could I give her mine too</line>
            <line>Got to the crib and called her up</line>
            <line>We got into a good conversation</line>
            <line>That's when she asked me could I fuck</line>
            <line>I said: "Maxine, check this out</line>
            <line>Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out."</line>
            <line>Got to the crib, she let me in</line>
            <line>She didn't waste time, she grabbed my hand</line>
            <line>And proceeded to the bedroom</line>
            <line>I said "Hold up, and stop proceedin', you rushin' things"</line>
            <line>What the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> are you doin'?</line>
            <line>So I went for my protection</line>
            <line>Took off my clothes and started flexin'</line>
            <line>As she went for my midsection</line>
            <line>I threw her down as I tore off her shirt</line>
            <line>Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about puttin' in work</line>
            <line>Before I hit it she said: "3, don't get mad</line>
            <line>But there's somethin' that I gotta tell your <phrase type="profanity"
                >ass</phrase>."</line>
            <line>I said "What is it? Another <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>? It's
                okay."</line>
            <line>She said: "No I forgot to tell you</line>
            <line>That I got AIDS, I got a problem."</line>
