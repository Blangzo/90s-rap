<lyrics><chorus>How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on</chorus>

<verse>As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, <phrase type="profanity">assed</phrase> out
Screamin', "Thug 'til I die!" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on</verse>

<chorus>How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on</chorus>

<verse>Yeah <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' <phrase type="dt">tricks</phrase> that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm so we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!</verse>

<chorus>How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we the last ones left, but life goes on</chorus>

<verse>Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the <phrase type="dt">hoes</phrase> that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> from old blocks, from old crews
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
</verse>
<outro>Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> doin' life
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> doin' 50 and 60 years and <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>
I feel you, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>! Trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>, life goes on
We're gonna clock now
Get money, evade <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase>, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>, we gon' be on top, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
You gon' be like, "Goddamn, them <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> came up!"
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase>
Hey, Kato! Mental!
Y'all <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> make sure it's poppin'
When we get up there, man, don't front
Life goes on
Hold me no more, hold me no more
Yes it do, yes it do, yes it do</outro></lyrics>
