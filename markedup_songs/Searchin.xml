<line>[Intro: Angela Workman]</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life, baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life, baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life, baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life, baby</line>

<line>[Verse 1: Eminem]</line>
<line>I'm reminiscin' on your tenderness</line>
<line>And the snugglin' and teasin'</line>
<line>Missin' what I remember</line>
<line>Kissin' and huggin' and squeezin'</line>
<line>Buggin' and wheezin'</line>
<line>I'm havin' trouble when breathin'</line>
<line>It's even tougher when sleepin'</line>
<line>But there's a couple of reasons that I'm sufferin' and grievin'</line>
<line>For lovin' and leavin'</line>
<line>You're all I'm thinkin' of in the evenin'</line>
<line>You got my knees bucklin' and weakenin'</line>
<line>Thoughts of nothin' but freakin'</line>
<line>That I'm strugglin' to keep in</line>
<line>And interrupt when I'm speakin'</line>
<line>I got some game that I'm preparin' to run</line>
<line>The way your lips sparkle and they glare in the sun</line>
<line>You got your hair in a bun</line>
<line>No matter what you're wearin' you stun</line>
<line>'Cause you're comparin' to none</line>
<line>I want to share in the fun, I feel a passionate lust</line>
<line>When I imagine it just alone at last when it's us</line>
<line>I see you graspin' to trust</line>
<line>But my intentions are good, let's leave the past in the dust</line>
<line>I'm not askin' to rush</line>
<line>And answer me immediately</line>
<line>I just wanna be there for you and you to be there for me</line>
<line>If you agree to repeat after me</line>
<line>"I love you" (I love you, baby)</line>
<line>‘Cause I just need you to see</line>
<line>How much I'm eager to be your man legally wed</line>
<line>Your love's keepin' me fed</line>
<line>This is easily said, so you can lead or be led</line>
<line>If you care to be down</line>
<line>‘Cause ain't nobody like you nowhere to be found</line>

<line>[Hook: Angela Workman]</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>

<line>[Verse 2: Mr. Porter]</line>
<line>Baby, it's all on you, it's you I call on, boo</line>
<line>Let's set a day up so you can fall on through</line>
<line>We'll take a spin in a Lexus</line>
<line>You can chill for dinner and breakfast</line>
<line>Long enough to see how this gentleman sexes</line>
<line>We'll start it off with caviar, Dom Pérignon</line>
<line>And then when it's a fact we are warm, carry on</line>
<line>We'll take it slow, see, nobody will hurry things</line>
<line>I got the Izze, the Bacardi and Hurricane</line>
<line>If Daiquiris are in debate and not your thang that day</line>
<line>It's still all right ‘cause I got Minute Maid and Tangeray</line>
<line>You're an incredible one that's rare</line>
<line>I bet in edible underwear</line>
<line>You'll look impeccable, none compare</line>
<line>I dream of freakin' you, the women that I'm speakin' to</line>
<line>It seems that there is not an end to things that we can do</line>
<line>So, now we all set to play, only thing left to say</line>
<line>Is when you step away, baby, look over in the négligée</line>

<line>[Hook: Angela Workman]</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>I been searchin'</line>
<line>But you're the one I want in my life baby</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
<line>Ain't no one special, special like you</line>
