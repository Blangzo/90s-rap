<lyrics><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
Oh <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>, jumped on my man's dick
Heard he had a twelve inch, now the <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> is lovesick
Who's to blame, the guy or the groupie
Heard I was down with D.U., now she wants to do me
Oooh-wee! This is the life
New <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> every night, never tripped off a wife
It ain't right, but it's cool how they come quick
Don't try to flip with the lip cause I run <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>
Hip hip, hooray for the AK
Spray when I lay competition, what a great day
Make pay, next is the wet sex
Hexed with the vex now they wreck with the complex
I'm set, wonder what I tote, check
Bloody as a Kotex, snappin' <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers'</phrase> necks
Revenge so sweet when it comes from
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> get done with the drum, watch my foes run
<phrase type="profanity">Nigga</phrase> keeps comin when they can't slip
Full of that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>, another hit from tha' lunatic

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Stretch]</featuredSinger>
Yeah, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> that God! Word up
Blowin' <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> out the <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> frame, you know what I'm sayin'?
Constantly, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> that trick, we ain't havin' it
</chorus>
<verse><featuredSinger>[2Pac]</featuredSinger>
Leave me the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> alone, you get none of this
It's suicidal, you lose your title like Doug-las
Cause I'm nothin' nice and, I'm icin' like Tyson
I'm grippin' the mic and my DJ is slicin'
I'm tired of <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> steppin' to me with the same old
Tryin' to do me like Nintendo
How the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> you think I ever got this far?
By bootin' <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> like a shootin' star
Cause I'm out to show that I'm a dope MC
Think crack had you fiendin', wait'll they get a load of me
<phrase type="profanity">Bitches</phrase> on my dick like a <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> condom
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> wanna flip, let 'em step, and I'll bomb 'em
See somethin' you want, why don't you come and get it
And then get waxed and taxed, like the government
Then I leave you sittin' there, wonder where your money went
While your <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> is callin' me, tellin' me to come again
<phrase type="profanity">Nigga</phrase> I'm loc'ed, when I smoke, from the indo
But we can be friends though, after you get broke like a window
That's what you provoked, and now you're smoked out
Lookin' like a <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase>, cause your whole <phrase type="profanity">fuckin'</phrase> posse, broke out
Punk <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> couldn't roll on
He couldn't hold on, game is too strong, <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase>
Leave me the <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> alone, you get none of this
Feel the wrath, and revenge of tha' lunatic</verse>

<verse><featuredSinger>[Stretch]</featuredSinger>
Yeah Tu', tell 'em <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase>, word up
We ain't havin' it, none of that <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>!
<phrase type="profanity">Bitch ass niggas</phrase>, <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> can't <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with us Tu', word up
'91, we takin' this whole <phrase type="profanity">motherfucker</phrase> over
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> got problems in '91, '92, and '93
And all that other <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>, word up</verse>

<verse><singer>[2Pac]</singer>
Recognize game when it smacks you, <phrase type="profanity">bitch</phrase> I'm back to rip
Puttin' this on the map with this mackin' <phrase type="profanity">shit</phrase>
Time will tell if it's made well
Well I raise <phrase type="profanity">hell</phrase> and excel cause it pays well
Jordan couldn't dunk it any harder, pump it any farther
I'm funky, that's word to the father
Act like you know 'fore I thump the bolo
Thought you was a pimp, now you're simpin' for my solo
Oh no, not another new jack, swearin' that he's ruthless
Ducked and now he's <phrase type="profanity">fucked</phrase> and left toothless
I can hear the <emotion>fear</emotion> in your flow, you ain't prepared
You're scared and you're bound to go
It's somethin', I guess I let the beat keep bumpin'
Stop trippin' off these <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> cause they ain't about nuttin'
Or should I say naythin'
Punk put my tape in, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> all the fake-in
I'm sick of the <phrase type="profanity">bullshit</phrase>
Come equipped and get ready to rip
Or get the dick of tha' lunatic</verse>

<chorus><featuredSinger>[Stretch]</featuredSinger>
Ah yeah, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> that, you know what I'm sayin'?
(The <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckin'</phrase> lunatic)
Yes Tu'!
Tell them <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> what time it is, 'kna'm sayin'?
(Punk <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase>, get the dick of the lunatic)
<phrase type="profanity">Niggas</phrase> can't <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> with us, word up
<phrase type="profanity">Bitch ass niggas</phrase>, <phrase type="profanity">fuck</phrase> 'em</chorus>

<verse><featuredSinger>[2Pac]</featuredSinger>
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> all them <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase>
I'm tellin' these <phrase type="profanity">niggas</phrase> that they ain't got
Naythin' on a <phrase type="profanity">nigga</phrase> like me
We squashin' these punk <phrase type="profanity">motherfuckers</phrase> in '91
'92, '93, and so on
So let the beat float on
While I spray these punk <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase>
With these dope <phrase type="profanity">ass</phrase> lyrics
Thanks to Poppa for supplyin' the dank
Now it's money in the bank
And all y'all <phrase type="profanity">niggas shit</phrase> stank
Compared to this shit
<phrase type="profanity">Fuck</phrase> y'all punk <phrase type="profanity">bitches</phrase>!
Tha' Lunatic *echoes*</verse></lyrics>
